The block is not stopping me from hounding her, since there is now nothing to be stopped. That is why I think it lost its purpose already.

Also, the comments were conclusionary, they did not provide the reasoning.  For example, the LA Times quote stated that she is bad.  Whoa!  That's an elementary school argument.  There was no explanation on WHY JRB is so \"\"bad.\"\"  that is NOT a NPOV presentation.  So go ahead provide the arguments and thinking against JRB, but provide the arguments and thinking FOR JRB also.  And conclusionary statments just don't cut it.

0	\"  == WIKIPEDIA IS ! ==  It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.  Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.  As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.  The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.  It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.  The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.  No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.  I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. The feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it had be	283

0	\"  Hi there!.. I'm just curious by your recent entry in the Philology introduction. \"\"The commonality, not the origin or age, of any studied languages, is important, thought those factors are important.\"\"... Could you add maybe one more line to define what you mean by 'commonality'? Do you mean: commonality of academic opinion? agreed upon terms of what the a particualr word might mean in a historical context? And I'm guessing that the factors you indicate that are important are the origin and age of any given word. I really cant quite see what you might think was insulting about the introduction... (I didnt write it by the way)... I think the point of the intro was to define where the word 'philology' came from... In latin it means 'grammatica'... Greek? I recall that 'philo' means love, and 'logo' ... well i dont know... But the origin of the word i imagine can have a number of sources... That is what makes words interesting and vibrant to me. I hope you can help clarify my question. I just think your entry could open a whole other line of questioning about the nature of philology.

Look forward to working with you.       : I have read other rules where they say if it is done multiple times, then be discussed. And I have seen several main editors, who I'm sure you would know if named, who dodn't follow BRD at all. : And I wasn't going to discuss my edit on Warm Bodies the second time round because I put it back with sources I found for it. If you weren't happy with that, then I would have discussed it. : But as you seem happy with it now, as you haven't reverted it, then there isn't any problem.     ::Just because they don't, doesn't mean you shouldn't. Old saying, \"\"do as I say not as I do\"\" comes to mind. In other words, do as Wikipedia says, not as other editors do, and you can't really go wrong.  ::It's not a case of being happy with it, I just don't want to edit war over it. I do not believe that it is classed as \"\"paranormal\"\" the lead needs sorting anyway as there are far too many genre's listed in the opening lead.       ::: The idea of free will also comes to mind. Like I said, if it was reverted a second time I would have said why it should have been included on the talk page. I'm not going to waste my time. I added an edit in and then later found a source for it. Paranormal romance is currently the only genre there with a source. As we are using our own opinions on the page, you don't believe paranormal romance should be included as there are too many genres, l well I personally think \"\"fantasy\"\" could go. The story is focusing more on paranormal romance than it is on the fantasy, it is inspired by the love story Romeo and Juliet.    ::::Good idea. I'll get rid of it. A source isn't usually needed for every genre. I will also transfer a copy of this conversation to the article talk page.

Eisenhower's former chief of intelligence and the first head of the CIA, General Walter Beedle Smith may have been brought in on the secret too, and the CIA began recieving some decrypted information in 1953.

0	== Totally ungrateful ==  I can't believe that someone would perpetrate intentional vandalism on a site like this which really espouses the ideals of information sharing, open information exchange, and honor-system based knowledge transfer.  I don't take his vandalism on my work personally, but I do take offense to two things: 1) People like this undermine the spirit of something like Wikipedia, something that has the potential to change the way that people learn and to help everyone in society have access to all kinds of information, for free (not counting Internet access). 2) People like this have no respect for the sacrifices of our predecessors.  Without people like Jimmy Launders fighting in conflicts such as WWII, and putting their lives on the line, the ability to openly share information and to have opinions would not exist - we would live in a fully censored society, as Nazi Germany was.  So by vandalizing Launders' page, this loser shows tremendous dis-respect for the risks that were taken and the sacrifices that were made by our ancestors who put their lives on the line and in many cases made the ultimate sacrific to ensure that we could live in a world where our thoughts, ideas, and communications were not censored.  But people like Kanupur don't consider that, they only think of things selfishly.  Personally, I'm glad that he's been blocked, and I don't care if he gets in trouble at work because of his work's proxy being blocked.  In fact, I hope that they do figure out that he was a vandal on Wikipedia, and that that's why his work's proxy has been blocked from Wikipedia, and that he gets disciplined appropriately by his employers.	474

It does not matter that the table \"\"has been there the longest\"\". If it doesn't comply with our policies and guidelines it needs to be fixed, not left in a non-compliant format. I am clearly not the only one complaining about the table. Numerous editors have attempted to change this and similar tables at various articles and you've reverted them without explanation. That's edit-warring, which can result in you being blocked from editing. There's even a Request for Comment open at WT:TV. However, even if I was the only one complaining, that's irrelevant. It just happens that I noticed the lack of compliance. Removing bolding from the table is simply not enough; the table needs to fully comply, which means incorporating row and column scopes, plainrowheaders, and fixing capitalisation problems as a minimum. There are numerous errors in the table that should also be fixed. You're obvioulsy aware of the existence of errors as you have fixed some yourself. As for being \"\"easier to understand, easier to read, catches the eye better\"\", the two tables are almost visually identical, so those are not valid reasons.

0	== Redraft of this article ==  I have removed all of the NPOV language littering the page, and have hopefully got it back on track.  I cannot find any genuine criticism of the new stadium design from any reputable published source, and as such have removed the section entirely.  Please do not return it to the text without providing sources - it is simply not enough for you to believe something to be true, you really do have to convince all Wikipedians that what you write is true by backing it up with evidence.  I think that further revision of the NPOV and personal criticisms of the design without sourcing would be vandalism, and I will ask an administrator to protect the article.  A huge number of news outlets, students and individuals will come to this page first when researching the new stadium.

0	:::Randall, the problem with the cited articles is that they don't actually name any groups or individuals, or provide any actual examples of the said myths. Now I assume that the leg wounds article is mostly addressing the SCA, who are known for fighting from their knees and not targeting the lower legs, but how is the ordinary reader supposed to know that? All they get from the link is vague intimations that somebody, somewhere thinks fighting from the knees is realistic. The other cited article is even less specific. :::Ideally, to cite a myth/misconception you should link to an actual case of someone stating that myth - e.g. an article stating that swords weighed 30 lbs - and then to a rebuttal article, or to an article that gives the source of the misconception as well as a rebuttal. Otherwise the reader has no way of knowing that the articles are actually addressing a real argument, rather than knocking down straw men.    	781

0	\"  == My position on the two Irelands, using Arbcom and admin abuse ==  I give my views on the two Irelands in the paragraphs below, but I will begin with what I feel is most serious.  I've had a look back, and IMO, there is one thing in particular I that is pressing for Wikipedia's future here:  The admin  must have his adminship fully questioned in the correct place. No one has a chance on Wikipedia when an admin acts (and wheel wars) like he has done – and I believe he has overstepped the line, and made a difficult but legal situation into a nightmare situation for everyone. I warned him of the mayhem that would be caused if Ireland was simply reverted into being a cultural all-island article, but he ignored me. This edit note (and selective deletion) is an example of the kind of intellectual demeaning by admin that lead to me losing my own temper. You cannot treat adults like children. It shows feelings of superiority in being an admin - which must not be condoned. Aside from his attitude, the way he reversed admin Tariqabjotu's Ireland Move, citing a very small hand-picked selection of admin who share his personal position on this - to his own personal wishes, was totally unacceptable. Where were all the other admin I saw who spoke up? For reasons I give after after I get the following paragraph off my chest, he completely shattered Wikipedia for me when he did that, and his reasoning for doing it showed it to be nothing other than an act of hypocrisy, as well as self interest. Arbitration are not there to be interested themselves (by their own admission) - they are only there to be there, and there is nowhere else now to to go. It has all been completely messed up now – so Arbcom has to be pulled in.  I regret that I am leaving Wikipedia with the worse kind of people in my mind, in a place that is actually full of fantastic unacknowledged philanthropy. I won't go the way of saying what I (100%, in all good faith, IMHO, genuinely, without doubt etc, etc) honestly think this is comparable to - people call it a 'Godwin', a commonly-used term which belittles the technical purity of the very example - an early internet 'battle' won by some clever person, for sure. But you have to think beyond the cliche. The talk-page admin 'cop out' over any car crash, is normally to pretend this place is just a pastime, but WIkipedia is a little more important than that - no? And conspiracy theorising - don't point that one at me – it us such an ugly slur. Who needs those, when you give ‘’individuals’’ so much power? People group - they always do. The only 'conspiracy' could be within wondering why Wikipedia has to be structured in this way. It's a Sunday drive, and includes the world - but anything difficult like this? The structure simply breaks down. So do some people want a loose ship? A negative answer would have little to do with the Irelands anyway.  Two wrongs don't make a right, and equally bad is a wrong made after a right. Now how was Deacon right? The first move to Ireland disam/(state)/(island) was rational and sound 'policy-over-polling', the reversal (in the horrendous way it was done) was wrong in every possible way. Those who were interested in doing so, simply needed to re-debate it from where it was (perhaps prove it in a global poll?). But why should I do even more work towards facilitating that? I have given hundreds of hours of my life to this already. And where now were those originally opposing? A number of them were addressing new content. The carefully avoided truth is that a global poll (so hard to bring about – I know, as I’ve tried) would simply bring in changes. I gave my time editing the changes I saw before me, and my work has been cynically thrown down the drain. And look at the edit frenzy now! Too few admin actually give a shit when people's time is wasted. The reversal of tariqabjotus's move has vindicated every troll, SPA, contentious editor, sock-maker and IP-abuser watching, who in this Ireland problem, are the worker-minions of the wholly-debilitating 'dual Irish country' \"\"solution\"\".  Ireland isn't Palestine, it isn't the People's Republic of China, it's just a country commonly called 'Ireland' on an island which has two states on it (one with a sea divide) - called Ireland - and Wikipedia, despite the efforts of so many, hasn't been allowed to properly address and present that undeniable fact. The Irish country now has two time-sharing homes again - two mixed-up modern-day country articles, one of them subsuming part of a separate country altogether - simply because it shares the island. Silly non-policy arguments about where to put historical 'Ireland's aside, there has always been an Irish nation (covering all or most 	1153

0	(UTC)  :MTBF has a lot of meaning, but it does not mean the device will last 136 years. All of these misunderstandings are really surprising. And it does not mean that you will not see a failure in home use. Saying you will never see a failure is just dumb.  What does it really mean? It means that one out of every 136 devices will have a mechanical failure every year. Or, equivalently, if there were 1360 devices spinning, then on average, 10 would mechanically fail every year. That is the meaning of 1.2 million hours. But, this needs to be put into context. Infant mortality is not counted, because those devices never were in use. Software failures, user failures, infrastructure failures (brownouts), heat and overheating, and viral or deliberate attacks are not counted either. So, a home user is still going to see the failure every few years. Even with enterprise drives. What the home user should not see is driving the drive to death. It should be built for continuous action of the head, and that action not fail for, on average, 1.2 million hours.   21:43, 9 February 2014	1168

Persians today call us by the ancient way of 'Armeni'. Which was during that time of Haik and even until the Hurri-Mitanni.

0	\" ::::Comment.  It's confusing enough that I am not sure what \"\"disagree\"\" means in this conversation.  A quick run through my sources indicates that \"\"folk costume\"\", \"\"folk dress\"\", \"\"national dress\"\", \"\"ethnic costume\"\", \"\"traditonal dress\"\" etc. are all used pretty much interchangeably.  I would support a move to \"\"folk costume\"\" or \"\"folk dress\"\" for the reasons cited above, but \"\"folk costume\"\" should not be a subset of \"\"national dress\"\" since modern political boundaries do not necessarily match either ethnic boundaries or political boundaries as they were at the time that folk dress was ossified (at least in Europe - as mentioned, some folk dress is still evolving).  ::::[For what it's worth, I wouldn't characterize square dance clothes or bolo ties as folk dress - western wear is a modern retro concept based on romanticized notions of 19th century clothing, and bolo ties are a modern invention!  But bolo ties and cowboy shirts are certainly regional dress.]  ::::By the way, the use of narrow use \"\"costume\"\" to mean \"\"theatrical costume\"\" is about as common as the use of \"\"dress\"\" to mean \"\"a woman's garment with a skirt\"\".  Both \"\"costume\"\" and \"\"dress\"\" have these narrow, non-specialist, everyday definitions which make it really difficult to decide what terms will be understood by users of Wikipedia.  \"\"Clothing\"\" is probably the most neutral and inclusive term, but we struggle in choosing \"\"Medieval clothing\"\" vs. \"\"Medieval costume\"\" vs. \"\"Medieval dress\"\".  And \"\"folk clothing\"\" is not used in the specialist literature and sounds really dumb.  In the museum and art-historical worlds, \"\"costume\"\" and \"\"dress\"\" are both preferred terms.  ::::OED definitions are pertinent here:  ::::*COSTUME: The mode or fashion of personal attire and dress (including the way of wearing the hair, style of clothing and personal adornment) belonging to a particular nation, class, or period. ::::*DRESS: Personal attire or apparel: orig. that proper to some special rank or order of person, or to some ceremony or function; but, in later use, often merely: Clothing, costume, garb, esp. that part which is external and serves for adornment as well as for covering.  :::: is right, in that there isn't a simple solution; we're going to have a ton of redirects and alterate terms whichever way we go.  Gievn the OED definitions, I'd say \"\"Folk costume\"\" is more accurate.  But I personally prefer \"\"Folk dress\"\", and I'd choose that over \"\"National dress\"\". -   \"	1232

I've only recently discovered this author; the one volume of his I read, Shifts, was brought home from (and subsequently returned to) what we call the \"\"pass-around\"\" box outside the library door, filled with individuals' discards that don't pass the librarians' muster for inclusion on the limited-space English-language shelves. (Resource restrictions prevent me from acquiring books by choice; happily, I'm largely content to make do with what comes my way.) I was impressed with this collection of short stories, a favorite genre of mine, and likewise noted the author's recognition as a poet and dramatist. Imagine my indignation, then, to discover he had no page in the English-language Wikipedia! As with other authors I consider worthy of promotion, I took the time and made the effort to create a page with what I could find on the Web, and was gratified to subsequently it expanded by fellow editors. Now thanks to you, I've added Ulverton to my want-to-read list. If you're an aficionado of short fiction, I can recommend some authors you might enjoy; do let me know if you're interested.

0	Hello, I see what I did became reverted. Yes, there is several ways to spell modern name for Yerevan. Problem is that Yerevan is in Armenian. The persian spelling is originally from Ilkhanid times and we see diverse spelling like Airavan, Irevan, Erevan and much more. The spelling used by EI is one I adopted. I thought it would be easy just to say Yerevan, but seems people are upset. I know Encyclopedia of Islam (English and Turkish version) will have articles about this and also the book by the American scholar Bournotian as someone above mentioned. His work is considered the most important work and most authorative on the topic and is a big book opposed to several page article in iranian encyclopedia. Also, anyone who studies this state will affeliate it with nothing but Persian empire of Safavids and Qajars and anyone between,. I studied bournoutian book beofre and he spends a lot to explain about ethnic groups of persians, kurds, armenians, and Turkic tribes (dozens!) with specific names and islaimc denominations, I think Qizil Bash, Qara Qoyunli (tribe name, not to be confused with famous states and organization associated with names), these Turkic people were not referred to as Azeris, but muslim tribesmen. I will get book soon and cite explanation for this. I understand and I share your sincere love to own people, its history and culture, but this  has no any relation to modern republic of azerbaijan.  	1478

I'm guessing that this has been done based on perceived importance in the castobviously those two names are frequently in the press and PD's \"\"McDreamy\"\" is a huge pop culture thing and it could be argued that PD/Ellen Pompeo and IW/Sandra Oh are the two \"\"big\"\" couples on the show, but that has nothing to do with the order of billingnor is the placement of IW and PD at the bottom of the list someone's idea of belittling their roles on the show.  I double-checked the order with the most recently aired episode, and based on that I switched T.R. and Justin Chambers, as well as JP, Jr. and Kate Walsh.  The credits read, \"\"with Isaiah Washington and Patrick Dempsey\"\"that final billing with the preposition \"\"with\"\" is actually a good thing, it reflects upon the actors' value to the show.

0	\"  == Trivia lesson  ==  Ok, I’m going to enjoy this… Here we go, amateur. You can reply where I indicated between paregraph so that the disscusion can be more organized:  1. Rupert Thorne was a recurring villain in a Kingpin fashion from the 2nd half of the 70's until the Crisis came. Then he was forgotten and then saved by Timm in the 90's for the animated series. Falcone is just a recurring name Frank Miller and Jeph Loeb use when he needs to mention Gotham City mafia. Carmine, was never a lead villain like Rupert has been. If you accuse me of just watching the animated series (which I deny) I can acuse you of just getting exited because of the Carmine appearance in the last movie. Maroni is just a support guy for Two-Face's story, as Tony Zucco is for Robin's (who is the nerd defending minor characters and bragging about how he knows nick names everybody knows, like \"\"Boss\"\" and \"\"roman\"\" , now? heh, heh, heh)  Reply:   2. every single comment can be sourced. Appealing to whom, for example is the easiest comment to source if you want to waste your time like that. Just check how many batman titles are published every single month and how many people buys against any other superhero's books. You will learn that monthly, the amount of baman books sold is good enough to call the mythos appealing. That's why there are 6 motion pictures, 2 animated series (without jl and superfriends and even scooby-doo appearances by joker, riddler, scarecrow and penguin) and, live action show and several internet about batman, his foes and his mythos. That's why the mythos is so appealing.  Reply:   3. Catwoman is dangerous. Following your logic maybe mr zsasz would be batman's worst enemy. Being a killer doesn’t make an enemy notable as his protagonism and his importance in the mind of Batman and Batman readers, writers and creators does. Knowing Batman's identity and not being completely on the good side makes her even more important. You seem new to the comics’ world, do you really think Catwoman is going to be Holly for so long? Context, PC, context. Selina has been a main character for more than 60 years, I’m talking about all those years. Not about the comic book you just bought on the corner store last week, my \"\"mate\"\". Following again your line of thought, it not worth saying Nixon was a president because he is dead. We couldn’t say Adam West was Batman because that show is of. And you called my ways childish…  Reply:   4. I think you might be confused. We are talking about Batman. You might be thinking of some other superhero. In batman comics bets are that, if you buy a batman comic from any year at random, or watch any episode form any batman series, also at random, The Joker, Catwoman, the Penguin, the Riddler or Two-face are going to be the main villain. If you get the croc, or scar-face, the mad-hatter you are loki, and if you catch you hero the \"\"Roman\"\" you are really, really a lottery winner. By the way there it’s something called figurative speech, and it means to compare situations, I dunno if they told you. They are not literary on a race.  Reply:  5. Hugo, the Scarecrow and the Hatter are influential because, whenever they appear, the story goes on a deeper lever exploring Batman's mind and messing with it. Those characters are useful tools when a writer wants to analyze Batman. Besides, I don't know if you are capable of using your imagination, I’m sure you can, it’s an indispensable tool for getting into the story when you read, but if someone messes with your mind on the level they have messed with Batman’s , that'll probably leave some ugly emotional scars on you... good thing he is the Batman. Therefore, they do get to be influential in a way. Thinking they don't get to appear as much as the five previous, therefore they are not influential is just wrong  Reply:  6. I put the first Clayface after mentioning that the previous are important. Don't make me doubt of your reading skills. How ever Basil Karlo has been important on and off and he started the Clayface concept and we have to point that. You talked about context to me, marking the appearance of the 1st Clayface, as I did, is context.   Reply:  7. I could doubt words I used like hot, sexy, bimbo and many other, that I once and again asked everyone to edit if they don't happen to like them. But I think is safe to say their creators intentions were to make those female characters look like that. Didn't you notice the curves in the drawings? I dunno about you but for most guys that could be a hot bimbo. In both comics and series Harley has been portrayed as a slut, sleeping with her teachers for a better note, killing his lover without caring and even was hinted as a playful lesbian in Hush.

0	\"  ==WP:SYNTH== An RfC was just closed at Talk:Climate change denial#RfC: Must the word 'denial; occur in every citation for climate change denial?, and it is interesting to read the closing statement there, in that it reflects community consensus about some aspects of when to use or not use sources about a topic without violating WP:SYNTH.    :The concluding statement says the term \"\"climate change denial\"\" may be used if the source \"\"implicitly states they fall into the general group.\"\"  It has no relevance to anything discussed here.  It certainly is not a loophole for \"\"synthesis\"\".     ::I don't think anyone is looking for \"\"loopholes\"\". I'm not arguing for any kind of slavish devotion to that discussion here, just for editors to take a look, and to think about it with an open mind. I think that the closing statement makes some good points about common sense.    :::There is nothing \"\"slavish\"\" about the devotion.  If most sources say the motivation of the terrorism is secular, then we cannot say it is religious and call it Christian terrorism.     :::: I was saying that we don't have to follow that other page slavishly. And that other page isn't talking about situations where most sources say something is unrelated. If you are interested in what it does say, then you can read it. If you don't want to read it, then don't. Everything here does not have to be a WP:Battleground.    :::As I have noted before, unless reliable sources attribute some religious motivation or aim,  I would not say Wikipedia should attribute such a motivation or aim.  If the sources ascribe motivation to irredentism, economic or other attribute and do not ascribe a religious aim, then it does not belong here.  Note the discussion just closed at Climate*.*  where the result was basically \"\"no consensus at all\"\".  Cheers.    ::::Not sure what you mean, but I linked to a discussion where the closer said there was a consensus. I'm not going beyond what the closing statement said there.    :::::The issue has come up in articles about terrorism and about ideology.  Different writers may use different terms to mean the same thing or the same terms to mean different things.  Generally, in peer-reviewed literature, the terms used are defined and we can say that one author who defines \"\"Christian terrorism\"\" as terrorism motivated by Christian belief and another who uses the term \"\"Christian religious terrorism\"\" with the same definition are referring to the same thing.  However, another author who uses the expression \"\"Christian terrorism\"\" and defines it as ethnic terrorism where religion is part of ethnic identity means the same thing as authors writing about \"\"religious communal terrorism\"\" carried out by Christians, or \"\"nationalist terrorism\"\" between different religious groups. :::::Can you provide a single source that should be included based on the opinion expresses in the climate change denial RfC? :::::   ::::::I'm so tempted to just reply \"\"yes\"\". And I really would rather not get into a wall-of-text over things that we will soon be discussing at the mediation. But let me try to clarify why I linked to that discussion. This isn't about definitions of \"\"Christian terrorism\"\" in my view. It's about what the closing statement there said, that just because a particular word is not used explicitly in a source, does not mean that the source does not apply to a page – editors can use common sense to examine the context within the source. Thinking back to the discussions about the Lebanon section (now made somewhat moot by the Schbley source, that examines in detail the Maronite Monks), there was discussion of whether it was SYNTH to consider a United Nations source, because it used the word \"\"genocide\"\" instead of the word \"\"terrorism\"\". I'm pointing out that there is now some precedent for using common sense in evaluating the language of such sources, in context. If you or another editor sees common sense in that instance as indicating that genocide is not terrorism, that's still a discussion we can have. So that's why I provided that link. I'm not about to rewrite the Lebanon section on t	1839

His shortcomings must also be mentioned in addition to his feats like winning the noble prize. Do you think it'd fit better in political views? In anycase it must, and will, be mentioned somewhere. How about adding this in his political views segment:   Peres' foreign policy outlook is markedly realist. For example, to placate Turkey, the only significant Muslim country in the region that is friendly towards Israel, Peres has explicity denied the Armenian genocide, which caused an uproar among genocide scholars.(citation)     ::Peres made these statements in 2001, when he was foreign minister. Clearly, he was caving in to Turkish pressure. Israel has very few friends and cannot afford to lose them, so basically it is not free to take the position that would seem to mesh with its outlook and history, which is to recognize that the Armenians were murdered en mass. Now he is president, an honorary position, not a political one, and his \"\"views,\"\" whatever they may have been back then, are worth about as much as mine are. I have no problem with mentioning this \"\"view\"\" in the section on his political outlook, but a separate section on this one utterance gives it undue importance and distorts the picture.     == sumac opening sentence ==  I don't know what the right wording is, but do you see the problem with \"\"Sumac (also Rhus) is a genus of approximately 250 species of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae\"\"?

Saint-Cyr is not obscure, but he was a later Marshal and really was not so important in the grande scheme of things, his reputation being largely created by his own post war writings and activities.

I prefer to structure the article this way so that the short story anthology and incomplete Maugham \"\"work\"\" have their own separate sections.

0	\"== It's not emo. ==  I had posted a topic about a band that has been labeled emo, only for someone to delete it. Stating that \"\"it is completely off topic, unproductive, unrelated to this article, and that belongs in a discussion forum\"\" Hello, this is a discussion forum for the emo page, if we have an issue with something on it, it's suppose to be displayed here and talked over. Do not delete peoples post because YOU think it doesn't fit to YOUR standards, it's for people to talk on.  With that, I repost my statement to WHY Coheed and Cambria are not emo.  First off, I'd like to take the time to say. Read this, and don't reply UNLESS you are agreeing, or are going to change this matter. If you are just going to sit there and whine because you are wrong about something, I don't want to hear it.  So here we begin...  Each song that Coheed and Cambria has made, has gone in flow with a comic that Claudio Shanchez (Lead Singer) has thought of in that brilliant mind of his. Some might claim some of the songs emo due to a few lyrics. Well, how else would you explain a painful moment, or happy moment in a story? A rhyme about whatever the heck \"\"junk in a trunk\"\" is? No, you'd have an explanation of the characters pain and happiness.  Perhaps you should read some stuff from wiki itself.  Within The Amory Wars page, (The comic made by Claudio)  \"\"The story follows the adventure of Claudio Kilgannon across the fictional solar system, far in the past known as Heaven's Fence, in an attempt to seek help from his Uncle, after his parents are tricked into murdering Claudio's siblings, and then murdered themselves by the Supreme Tri-Mage and ruler of Heaven's Fence, Wilhelm Ryan.\"\"  All of their songs came from a point in the story, if you had known the story, you'd not tag them as emo at all. Because in fact they are not, it's a story. Get over it and stop with all of this \"\"scene\"\" stuff.   It's all a story, unlike other bands that cry and scream about \"\"I want to die, no one understands me, I have it so bad, My girlfriend left me because I am whiny\"\"  Understand what I am pointing out?  Emo is the most ridiculous label ever, yet sadly it is here and people wont let it die willingly.  So, why not research bands before you label. While you are at it, read the Coheed and Cambria comics, they are quite the epic. This now ending my humble opinion on this matter of why they shouldn't be in this \"\"Emo label\"\" scene.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by   •     :Doesn't matter if they are or aren't emo.  They're listed here as a band that has been called emo.  In fact, that's the point of the paragraph - to demonstrate how nebulous the term is.  :If you want the related Wikipedia guidelines - all we have to do is supply a reliable source (per WP:RS) that confirms that C&C; have been called emo.  Source.  That's it.  That's all we need.  Any amount of rambling about how they are or aren't emo is irrelevant.    ::And you trust MTV? The people that don't even play music anymore, pathetic.

Blog is a blog, we have used it as multible sources on additional articles, and we have also used MTV News as a reliable source, and that in itself is a blog.  Alchemist  Luis Resto Rikanatti Eminem also acts as a producer for the label, and since he is the founder, CEO, and signed to the label as its main artist, I would presume that linking references for him as a producer is frivalous and uneeded.   Now, The Bass Brothers and Eminem have ended their working relationship. We have multible sources for this including when Em purchased his new studio, and F.B.T sued Interscope/Aftermath.  However, with that said, we have no additional proof that DJ Head has ended his working relationship with EM. We have no source saying that he has, and unless you supply one, we're going to be leaving him in the active section. Just because a producer didn't release any tracks for the label in a while does not constitute their absence from the label.  So Please, Let me re-add Alchemist, Eminem, Mr. Porter, Luis Resto, Rikanatti, and DJ Head to the production list, and let us move on with our lives. No need to keep pricking this crap in the butt.  Also, \"\"DJ Green Lantern\"\" should not be under the \"\"former artist category.\"\" If you leave him there, you're going to have to add the other Producers/DJs onto said list when and if they leave the label.\"	2557

You have repeatedly made false accusations against me without a single time providing a diff. I am well aware of what I have written and where it was written. I have not called you or anybody else such a word anywhere on Wikipedia. The most outrageous thing in the diff in which you were blocked for was not your reference to \"\"cancer\"\". It is your persistence in spreading false and malicious commentary about me. In that diff you say When Nableezy had the balls to say that he knew someone was a sockpuppet but that he was keeping his mouth shut because he likes him it showed that he was here for one reason and one reason only. Post a diff that backs that comment up. Just one, try to find one. Later on you say this time he called people cunts. Could you please provide a diff in which I call people (pl) cunts (pl) or even a person a cunt? Of course you cant, but that doesnt stop you. I dont even care if you are blocked or not, I wanted an admin to make you stop making these outrageous accusations without providing any evidence. Earlier you made several allusions to various people who think I was socking. You back out of it by saying \"\"Im not the one accusing you, just other unnamed people do\"\", as if that allows you to drop such an accusation with out one bit of evidence.The other problems with your comment aside, the accusation that you made that I \"\"breed cancer\"\", that cancer being sockpuppetry, shows only how obsessed you are with directing fault to me. You think I am the reason NoCal or Dajudem socks? Really? I, hoping that I am right, will assume you say this because you are just unaware of the actual history, as opposed to purposely ignoring or distorting it. Much of this happened before my time here, but before I got involved in editing here I read a quite a bit of the history, through article and user talk pages and archives, AfDs, ANI, AE, AN3, ..., and the arbitration cases. So I have a certain familiarity with the actors of this play and know the story fairly well. Once upon a time, there was a user named Isarig. This user has had their account \"\"vanished\"\" to . Some things I dont know, as the user's talk page is deleted, and others dont need to be discussed, but this user vanished at the start of the ARBPIA case. The user already had a history of socking, how much is one of the things I dont know. This happened late 2007/early 2008, with his last edit talking place on Dec 24 2007. NoCal100 was created Jan 3 2008. Canadian Monkey Dec 30 2007. Mr Hicks The III is an older sock, from Sep 2007. There were a few others created back then. All this before this monstrous creature you refer to as Nableezy arrived and caused this man to start socking.Now, as for your BFF (Stellarkid). The account Dajudem was given a topic ban after the CAMERA lobbying issue came to light in April 2008. One month later the Tundrabuggy account was created. One of the first things this account did was to go after, in a purely vindictive manner, one of the admins who had dealt with that issue. She, dishonestly posing as a new editor confused by the rules, was able to game the system into producing several blocks or bans against that admin. She followed him from article to article, going away from the A/I area into random areas such as Persian history. She was able to hide the fact that she was doing this for some time, until she was discovered as Dajudem's sock and blocked. One month later, a new account, Stellarkid, is created. Posing as a new account confused by the rules, this new sock proceeds to do the same thing she did with that earlier admin with a new target (guess who?). She is able to successfully get a ban placed against her target. When this account is discovered to be a sock, a new account (in fact several) was created. Three separate accounts were blocked last time around, including one with no edits just waiting to be put in to use. So Dajudem began socking prior to ever seeing me, yet I am responsible for her continued socking? And NoCal? I am responsible for dozen or so different accounts that I know that he has, and that isnt counting the ones from Isarig? How can you possibly blame me for the fact that a number of die hard members of the Defenders of the Glorious Cause have repeatedly socked?But back to the point, dont make accusations that you cant provide evidence for. Either provide a diff of me calling somebody a \"\"cunt\"\" or retract the charge. Same for the accusation that I knowingly overlooked sockpuppetry because I liked a user. '''''' - \"	2619

0	\"  :Hello 71, and welcome to Wikipedia! Thanks for the question. One of the most basic rules here is that information in articles must be \"\"sourced\"\" to a \"\"reliable source,\"\" which is explained here: WP:RS. In the case of the Montana edit that you made, all the published sources list Joe's birthplace as New Eagle, Pennsylvania. If you have a published source that says Butte, Montana, you would have to insert it after the edit that you make. One way to do this is to click on the open book icon above the editing window to the left of \"\"Advanced.\"\" A dialogue box will appear in which you can paste the URL for your source, or you can list the publication. The preferred method for sourcing, though, is listed here: WP:CT.  :Unfortunately, insider information like knowing JM's son cannot be used as a source. Sources must be reliable and published, as above. I have some firsthand experience with this. One of my younger brothers is Terry Moran, and for several years the Wikipedia article had the wrong birth year for him. This was because the ABC News website had the wrong year - but I could not change the year and say \"\"he's my brother and I know when he was born.\"\" I had to find a published source that confirmed the correct date. That's how things work here. I hope you'll enjoy editing article here at Wikipedia! Regards,   \"	2722

0	== Pride Grand Prix Brachets ==  While looking back at the past pride champions and grand prix's i noticed that there are no brackets available for viewing for 3 of the 8 tournaments.  the 2004 Heavyweight Grand Prix, the 2005 Welterweight Grand Prix, and the 2005 Lightweight Grand Prix do not have any brackets available for viewing on wikipedia.  I feel that tournament brackets are a necessity for people to easily follow the tournament/Grand Prix accuratly.  If someone could create such a bracket, not necessarily on this page, it would be great.  In my opinion the brackets should be created on the page of the event in which the tournament finals took place at.   	2745

From WP:NPOVAll Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view, representing fairly, and as far as possible without bias, all significant views that have been published by reliable sources. Glenn Beck does not, in and of himself, represent a significant point of view, and he is certainly not a WP:RS when it comes to information about Van Jones and ACORN. Especially when it comes to the ACORN stuff, the part of WP:NPOV you're neglecting is that the POV needs to be properly published by reliable sources. Furthermore, WP:WEIGHT instructs us to give weight to these points of view according to their prominence in reliable sources. Thus, when you post blogs, links to Beck's own website, web polls, etc... You are still not providing reliable sources. Cptnono presented us with sources like the NY times and The Washington Post, and I was immediately willing to work on the section with him. We are in no way ignoring Beck's POV here, but the idea of him \"\"leading\"\" the criticism of Jones is an opinion, and per WP:RS must be directly attributed to its owner. —      \"	2861

0	\" : Wow, I honestly don't know where to begin to respond to that ~ so lets start with your \"\"talking points.\"\" First off, I'm not trying to Americanize the article, somethings were changed (like donburi to rice bowl) but they are largely a manual of style issue than anything else. Next off, I'm not egotistical so showing off my editing skills is a non-issue, plus this is Wikipedia, someone else editing your work is a fact of life. Third, Deja Vu Artworks is based in Japan, if I worked for them that would seem that I lived in Japan as well, in which case, why would I want to Americanize the article?  Which brings us to trying to improve the article. As noted before, a good chuck of infomraiton in the original revisions was irrelevant - you do NOT need a song listing from a flash animation in an article that is a general overview of a subject. Also, the Deja Vu information was removed because it was unsourced and I can't seem to find any indication of resolution for the topic - it happened in 2004 and it is now 2007 either it was resolved or it fell by the way side, where as the Netrunner controversy is still on going and received a great deal of notice when it happened. If there is a bunch of information on Deja Vu that I am missing then by all means, point out some links and we can work it into the article. Now, in regards to most of the changes - this article toes very close to the fancruft category and as such most of the edits are there to try and pull it away from that category. In case you haven't noticed, most of the information in the List of OS-tans article is gone because that article was deleted; one of the reasons for which was fancruft. Now all that said, there is no reason why the descriptions of the top five 'tans can be expanded a bit, but you must remember that should not be a full bio of the characters, plus the fact that they can be changed at an artists whim means that you can't write in the matter of \"\"OSX-tan is always seen poking XP-tan\"\" with a stick - that is just one thing that an artist can do.  \"	3120

1	Ooooh, here's our Swiss neutralist! And what does this administrator bring to the table this time? Let's see, accusations of parroting, arbitrary classification of users based upon pen-name preferences, straw-men, ignoratio elenchi, and finally begging the question through the same fallacious reasoning as previously. We call that petitio principii, don't we? Apparently nothing will change his mind until I change my pen-name to something like John Doe. How does he know that I am not this Russian dude who likes Iranian history and culture? Oh, that's right, he doesn't. He probably didn't check my IP-address to see that I'm based in Sweden and could in fact be a Swede. Whoops... Sounds like our neutralist is using a subtle profiling method to his convenience.  Like I stated before, it doesn't matter if I'm a Nazi, Communist, Liberal or even a hippie. It doesn't matter if I do drugs, or if I look even remotely like a reptile. It doesn't matter if I'm even an obese Tongan kid. It has no bearing on content or the essentials of an argument, and anything else you might conjure to the favour of some imagined affiliation. This is aptly called speculation.  Now, I will only say two things. First one is a rehearsal of my previous suggestion: Livius.org is visited by thousands of people daily. Along with a number of other scholar-related websites, I can't live without checking it by a daily basis. It deserves a Wiki-article, where Jona Lendering is briefly described as the founder and maintainer of an outlet with roots as far back as -96. Yes, sounds like a plan of revenge. The paragon of Pan-Iranic resurgence! The removal of a Wiki-article of Lendering will remove the last great obstacle to a resurgent Achaemenid empire and the reawakening of the terrifying Persian horsemen of doom! Howl! Howl! Our world is forfeit!  Second point, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart: Get laid. Your superior-inferior complex isn't convincing anyone here, whether they be Iranian or not. There is no chance an article of this quality gets to stay. That's the bottom line, irrespective of any perceived reasoning. Either change the article so that it pertains to Livius.org, or stop your incessant whining. Maybe it never occurred to you that by simple observation Jona Lendering has written several Iran-friendly articles and has generally sought to dispel several popular misconceptions on the ancient Iranians. Maybe that's how you make more drama in your life, by arbitrary holier-than-thou attitude.   Idiot.     	3354

This personage, it is stated, had two sons, Muirich Mhor and Dhai Dhu. From the former of these was descended Clan Mhuirich or Macpherson, and from the latter Clan Dhai or Davidson. Sir Aeneas Macpherson, the historian of the clan of that name, states that both the Macphersons and the Davidsons were descended from Muirich, parson of Kingussie in the twelfth century. You suck, and this site sucks and your edits are complete crap but I'm sure you feel justified somehow in your pathetic view.

Examples of terms that engender such fears are becoming common but have existed before. Islamic terrorism, socialized medicine, and yellow peril are examples of phrases used in the media and by politicians which, it is claimed are or were intended to frighten people.

0	\"  == Suggested changes (received via email) ==  Hi all,  The following proposed changes were received via email to OTRS. I submit them to the talk page for consideration and adaptation by anyone who is interested in the subject matter:  Nathan  Sonenshein (2 August 1915-April 13, 2001) was a rear admiral in the United States Navy. A native of Lodi, New Jersey, Sonenshein began his four-decade naval career by attending and receiving a commission from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1938. In 1970, he was head of the Navy's Bureau of Ships, just before it became the Naval Ship Systems Command. .  His thirty-six year career in the Navy spanned an era that began on the eve of World War II and lasted into the seventies.  He was decorated for distinguished performance as Chief Engineer of a carrier during the Korean War. Later assignments in the Bureau of Ships included that of Director of Ship Design. After selection to Flag rank, he was chosen as one of the Navy's first Project Managers. This project led the design of the Fast Deployment Logistics ship, which portended today's Rapid Deployment Force. In its design, Admiral Sonenshein successfully pioneered a new approach which quantified for the first time, top level mission requirements and translated them into ship design parameters to achieve the optimum functional performance.  At the peak of hostilities in Southeast Asia, a period marked by tremendous strain on material, personnel and time resources, Admiral Sonenshein was selected to be Commander, Naval Ship Systems Command.  After his retirement in 1974, Sonenshein lived in Fairfax, Virginia. He moved to Moraga, California less than a decade later and became assistant to the president of Global Marine Development, Inc., in Newport Beach, California. In 1982, he received the American Society of Naval Engineers' Harold E. Saunders Award, which honors \"\"an individual whose reputation in naval engineering spans a long career of notable achievement and influence.\"\" In 1983, he was a member of the Marine Board of the Commission on Engineering and Technical Systems of the National Research Council. During his tenure, the board produced a report, \"\"Criteria for the Depths of Dredged Navigational Channels.\"\"  On July 1, 1984, he was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to a two-year term as one of eight members of the National Advisory Committee on Oceans and Atmosphere. The Reagan Administration's choices for the panel membership drew criticism from environmentalists, who noted that it included no atmospheric scientists.  One of the committee's more controversial reports during his tenure suggested that U.S. shipyards be allowed to go out of business rather than be propped up by government subsidy. The report, released July 16, 1985, concluded that the country's shipyard capacity is \"\"considerably greater\"\" than would be required in a major conventional war. Using classified Pentagon studies, the report concluded that shipyards could expand production by 3 1/2 to six times, providing all the new ships that would be needed. \"\"Look at England in the Falklands\"\", Sonenshein told the Washington Post. \"\"In less than two months, they were able to modify and convert some 50 of their merchant ships that were then used for naval operations...Sure, it's always better to have more shipyards and more merchant ships to give you a margin of safety. But the hard question is, are you going to pay for it? I wouldn't pay for any more than we now have.\"\" [1]  Sonenshein died at Kaiser Permanente in San Rafael, California, aged 85. He was buried at Oakmont Cemetery in Lafayette, California.  He is survived by a daughter, Carol Sonenshein Manashil, a son, William Sonenshein and three grandchildren: Sarah Irving, Thomas Allen King and Elizabeth Manashil.  Regards,  \"	3733

0	I can understand your reasons for taking a break. As I have been indicating, the atmosphere is severe. It can have a severe effect on folks unused to such atmosphere. I had noticed that you were saying something about infoboxes at the ANI. As far as I know, there is no set vetting process required for putting up any infoboxes. So, anyone can put up any infobox they want. I don't see much of a value in such infoboxes. I like to form my own opinion based on the particular user's edits and comments only. Looking at the edits and comments of some of the folks who do have infoboxes...... Actually, to my way of thinking, there is no need for such infoboxes. Things become easily obvious from edits and comments alone. I do not say anything about your edits and comments because I think I am unqualified to make an assessment for your contributions. I think I have known some fine scholars on WP and have participated in some exhilarating discussions with them. But invariable, I find their userpages without any infoboxes saying it. Why does one need state the obvious? Actually, I think there are some disadvantages to putting up such infoboxes. If you are seriously considering putting up one, I think you may want to know my detailed view on it in beforehand. Looking at some of your comments, I have the most unmistakable impression that you have an excellent grasp of such issues. I have known very few users about whom I could say the same. (I am speaking only about the ones which I have seen). As such, I was looking forward to other people's sense of sourcing issues would also improve (by having discussions with you). I have also been looking for a particular quote from one particular source and I had the impression that you might probably be in a position to help me in that regard. It is about some other, unrelated article. But since you are busy now, I don't think it would be proper for me to bother you with some silly request of mine.  I have noticed that the catalyst with sidekicks is happy because they have been able to drive you away.  Actually, it seems to me that they have driven away hundreds of users and also caused blocks on scores of others, are experts at harassing others with warnings, long winded arguments, irrelevant comments, severe ad hominem attacks, etc. etc. etc. also know how to obtain blocks for their opponents at ANIs..... Anyway. Regards.-  	3744

0	I have to disagree that it has any place outside of a speculative mention within this article.  This is mostly because all of the science surrounding powered descents without heatshields due involve the concept of a tethered descent.  All of the science regarding this topic is contained within the topic of the space elevator.  This includes the material concerns, robotics, energy transfer to power the climbers, etc.  Even more notable is that all the talk on this topic mostly concerns ascension, ie placing satellites into orbit.  Very little is concerned about or researched on the topic of descension with a space elevator.  Mind I call it a space elevator because this is the recognized term used to describe it within technical circuits, including NASA and other research institutions.  I agree that the idea is a possibility within 200 years for a powered descent without heat shielding,  but as of now, there is simply no research, talk or even speculation on any project to even look into it.  Thus, a mention at best within the article.     	3901

You're going to be under much greater scrutiny from now on, and I'd suggest you view it as a learning opportunity to make your content even better.

I've been off-wiki for a bit, but I'll be getting around to my old \"\"beat\"\" soon, which includes DRV normally, so, should you have other problems, I'll be happy to help.  Best wishes,    :::On looking at the DRV again, I do notice Dmcdevit there, and he isn't arguing a sound position, although he is being civil.  Surprising, I must say.  Anyway, I hope he's just having bad day... I've probably been grumpy myself lately, what with the flu, the snow, the relatives, etc. )     == last word in ==  The first question you need to ask yourself is, \"\"do I have a history (perhaps as yet unadmitted) of being overly critical of myself?\"\" If the answer to this might be yes, then you can't always trust your own tendency to self-criticize, because your subconscious motivation is not self-improvement but self-denigration; don't pay that too much heed then. If, however, the answer is no, then if you notice a behavior of yours that bothers you, listen to the notice, and decide cognitively how much it really bothers you or should bother you. Sometimes we only notice what bugs us about ourselves by trying to observe ourselves objectively. You might be doing that, and you might do well to listen, but it's hard for me to weigh this. As for my own opinion, looking at Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2006 December 11#Abortion, you haven't added anything that was redundant, so I wouldn't say it's an issue. If the discussion gets long and people keep bringing up things that you've already answered, remember that the closing admin is going to read everything and they should notice if you've already answered a repeated objection. Then it's a question of how much faith you have in the admins (I know, I'm treading on very thin ice now). For instance, I made sure to answer everything at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Faith Freedom International because I wanted to be absolutely certain that if the article did get deleted, I couldn't blame myself for not trying everything. I'm likely to do the same thing at Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2006 December 5#Ali Sina if anyone opposes the citations I've dug up. But my motivation here is dedication to freedom of speech and for less critical articles I leave my comments for the admin and let it go. A rule of thumb that you should know is that if an article is up for deletion and 80% of the votes are keep, it will probably be kept (even though it's \"\"not a vote\"\"). If it's less than 80%, then the keepers will have to put forward a pretty solid argument to keep. As you can see at the Faith Freedom AfD, keepers had about 66% and we just barely came through with \"\"no consensus\"\". I suspect that the factors that weighed most heavily for the admin were TruthSpreader's and my arguements, as almost no one else seriously argued the merits of the citations and notability guidelines.  Hope all that helps. —   —    == Why Assume good faith, and assume again ==  I'd been on alert for vandalism on Baiji and its talk page Talk:Baiji for days, ever since it went on the main page, when I noticed  this edit by [[User:Dante Alighieri|Dante Alighier	4371

0	Hi Elen, apart from chewing your ear for the first deletion tag I have generally seen your own actions as even handed and I would extend this comment to a few of the other editors, all who disagreed with my view but after seeing how Wikipedia works internally I confess to being little else than disgusted at the sheer stupidity involved and I point that criticism at the mechanics of the successful removal of the page stub for JWASM I bothered to write for Wikipedia. The same antagonist tried to trash the MASM page that I rewrote earlier and from his comments in its talk page it is only a matter of time until he does it again. An earlier editor tried to get some content into the MASM page by scouring the MASM32 web site and linking to web pages that I wrote for the masm32 user base and while I was willing to tolerate this and did a reasonable amount of work on the MASM page to try and get it up to date and relevant so it was no longer needed, in the face of endless obstruction I will simply resolve the problem from outside Wikipedia. You are correct in the idea of taking the bat home but it goes further, pulling the stumps and taking the ball and stumps as well then ploughing the field and leaving the mess for the antagonist to clean up. Regards and thanks for your efforts.   	4381

(So , all the children that are born in Canada and die before being registered are foreighners)    The problem I have with the consensus version: 1. It is not a consensus, not everybody agrees 2.

Likewise, some on the Left stand accused of a double standard w.r.t. Islamist terrorism, again, adopting a high moral tone that masks their acceptance of it.

You are invited to comment at Wikipedia:Templates_for_deletion#Template:Video the discussion at the template's entry on the Templates for Deletion page.   The nominator Chris Cunningham/User:Thumperward removed the template from all the articles and then nominated it for deletion. This is a well-known Wikipedia:Ownership gambit by stealth removing a feature with mass edits and then claiming it's not used as a reason for deletion.   He then reverted my attempt to keep the video template on an article page at least until the deletion discussion is completed. This prevents editors from making any comparisons on the technical merits of the template, which further forces you to accept his ownership of articles presenting videos. I have requested a Speedy Keep due to his unconsensed mass edits, until there can be an informed and un-owned editorial discussion on the technical merits.  Until he again re-reverts, you can at least temporarily revert his edit to see what the video template looked like, and then consider the technical issues on their merits which are described at the template deletion discussion.  	4548

0	== Architects Act 1977 ==  Thanks for your intervention on this page.  I agree you're probably right to remove the lengthy footnote, but my reason for supporting your removal of the reference would be different, namely that as time goes by some information loses its topical interest and becomes more abstruse (which is, I imagine, the reason it was placed in a footnote and not in the body of the text in the first place).  I therefore appreciate your placing the information on the talk page, for you never know, a serious researcher rather than just a casual visitor who takes a general interest in primary legislation may derive genuine satisfaction in finding it there; the very distinction, I hope you will agree, that marks an encyclopaedia (which should be an extensive knowledge resource) apart from a penny guide-book.  A few points however: *You have left some external links (Blair, Kelly) which had relevance to the detailed former footnote but not to the article. *There is a balance between referencing all statements and introducing clutter.   *The bullet-point statements are accurate (and, in point of fact can be verified easily enough by looking at the linked pages).  And as to technology, if you have a way to put a reference on a footnote using the edit pages, then you are a lot cleverer than I am. *Your criticism is a little disparaging.  It may of course be both accurate and justified, but pejorative language such as yours is quite difficult to read with a constructive attitude.  Perhaps it needs charity?  May I suggest that for the sake of the average grump you adopt the style of academia (which I admire but am no part of), which is to achieve a result coming up with an improvement rather than a half-baked detraction?   	4575

Since the subject of links has been broached, I wonder if it wouldn't be good to try to resolve that category next, rather than item by item. A cross-wiki link to Wiktionary may be better for some of the links, but for now, I'd like to focus on only the issue of whether the word should be linked or not.  What should not be linked Plain English words: *crocodile *universe *mortality *theistic  The time, space, causation, change and eternity articles do include sections on philosophy, but it is embarrassing that the only comment on Asian thought on these matters I found was one sentence in Causality. Consequently, a reader of this article would find little of help in those. Moreover, this article does not discuss the philosophy of time, space, causation, change or eternity in any significant detail. But, I would support linking to those articles once they include significant Asian philosophical content. But, even then, the link should be to the philosophy section, not to the top of the article. I didn't find anything on philosophy or religion in universe or mortality. *time *space *causation *change *eternity  What should be linked Major connections with the subject of another article that will help readers to understand the current article more fully: *Vishwanath *Kashi *Shiva *Ishwara *Manisha Panchakam But only if the article is written promptly. *Nrsimha *Kali *Laksmi  *Buddhism *South India Kashmir is linked, so South India or India should be linked as well (but only the first occurrence). The second is a redlink.

I replaced in the place I found it the actual picture of him posing in front of the stacked bodies at what I am sure was Buchenwald, and Anne-Marie von Hueber – de Grazia said that he had also been to Auschwitz. I did not know this until she made the statement on Facebook in connection with the photo. My father tended to self-aggrandizement and liked Jews who he thought were very smart. He also tended to be a Sophist, or sophistical. He could have written a lot with intent, or purposively. But still, why are you choosing this man, who did so much for humanity, as any sort of model for any sort of behavior that you might find unfavorable to your interests? The Nazis made their own bed and dragged the German people into it. The bombing of cities had already begun in WWI with German Zeppelins hitting London. The British chose to be the first to bomb German cities in WWII, but it would have started with German bombers in due time. I wandered the battlefields of Europe for years, just feeling the pain and division; even in my own mind and family, and grew up with young men and women who had lost their parents in the War, years before. Find someone else to pillory. Al de Grazia should be left in peace; he did his duty and it was rough from the start. He accomplished miracles considering all. Wikipedia is not good for you or your cause; it is filled with crap that anyone with a brain can see is made up to suit the authors’ purposes. I believe the term is “whole cloth;” right from the weaving mill and ready to be cut to suit the maker’s needs.

0	\"  :Dear Arkaever, what you write makes absolutely no sense - and your spelling of \"\"hypothesis\"\" with \"\"hi\"\" at the beginning is the first hint that it is so.  :Everyone who has ever visited places both in the continental climate and near the ocean must know that places near the oceans have much more stable temperatures (while the continental climate has much more brutal variations) because the relevant layer of water has much higher heat capacity than the relevant layer of soil. The water is circulating and can actually swallow or release the heat from up to hundreds of meters of the upper ocean pretty quickly; on the other hand, it takes years for the heat to get dozens of meters of the soil.  :That's also why the continental ice sheets are much more variable - and much more important for the global variability of the climate - than effects that occur on the sea. They may appear or disappear mostly on the Northern Hemisphere. At any rate, the Milankovitch theory works, as settled in Roe's paper.

0	\"  == Angels and Christian Angelic Hierarchy ==    Hey, you deleted my stuff because I didn't cite sources. But my claims were never \"\"scholars believe this\"\" so I don't think I should have to cite anything. In \"\"Angel\"\" I simply said that because of the ambiguity of the word angel it is possible that people are misinterpreting passages containing it. It's perfectly rational and so you should judge it on its content, not its origin.   Along the same lines is my contribution to \"\"Christian Angelic Hierarchy\"\". Simply read the Bible passage that I quoted. It clearly talks about Christians being against the \"\"powers, thrones and principalities.\"\" The whole chapter is talking about how Christians are to be against corrupt human authorities. My point makes perfect sense. Even though I can't quote some scholar who thinks the same way, it is clearly a valid point of view.    Hell, it seems like every single wiki on here about religion has some \"\"unscholarly criticisms\"\" within in, and there's nothing wrong with that. Just because someone's idea isn't in a book doesn't make it untrue, and just because some random nobody wrote a book doesn't make them right. I mean, what if you delete my post now, but then I publish a book in a few months that briefly mentions my opinions on angels; can I then quote and cite my own book and have my post stay up on Wikipedia? Or what if I quoted some random sermon a preacher posted on his church website- is that fit for Wikipedia? What if I was that preacher? What if I was some random guy (like I am) and I made some single page essay, then quoted it on Wikipedia, saying, \"\"some people have argued that...\"\"?

The rationale was clearly given: \"\"Expired PROD, concern was: Notability has not been established, lacks significant coverage in secondary sources\"\". Even with my attempt to look for reliable sources, there was hardly anything that established notability of the company. —    ::What does it take to establish notability? In general all airlines are considered to be notable, See Wikipedia:WikiProject Aviation/Notability which says \"\"All airline companies\"\".  But if you want to delete one you can delete Aspiring Air which is no longer in business.  When you put it back I can put a list of sources such as from the New York Times     :::There's a general notability guideline that will show a general idea of what an article should contain. Since you plan to work on the article, I went ahead and restored it. I trust that you will add the sources you speak of to establish notability of this topic. —    == Restore my cousins page thank you... ==  YOUR REFERENCE...

POV involves actual content issues where unverified and/or biased comments are made in the body of the article in relation to the subject (like saying \"\"Roosevelt High School is known for its strong academic programs\"\" without any third-party sources to verfiy).  It would be one thing if I owned the kentschools.net domain and was pushing it to further my own viewpoint or product or kentschools.net was not an official school site, but neither is the case.  The difference between the two domain names is simply a matter of technical ownership, but not one of content or one being \"\"official\"\" and one not.  Also, they are not redirects to each other.  For example, the popular website http://www.espn.com is actually a redirect to the real address.  If you type in www.espn.com (or click on the link), you will see the address in your browser change to http://espn.go.com.  If that were the case here, say kentschools.net redirected to kent.k12.oh.us, then yes, it would make sense to simply type in the actual address rather than the easier to remember one.

0	Jiang, you're quite confused.  Where does it say I've backed off?  I cited Fairbanks as a prime example of someone who uses it in the third sense.  You've also quite erroneously mixed up what wikipedia policy says about definitions.  The intent is to prevent extremely short articles, and for them, it suggests that you extend them.  It also tries to group very related terms together.  Chinese Republic is related to different things, depending on the context of where a person might have read about it or what point of view the person is coming from.  Republican China, for example, we agreed to point to History of the ROC since it is most appropriate for someone looking for something about .  But for someone who says Chinese Republic means the ROC exactly, we can't point him there, we have to point him towards ROC.  And then there's the third definiton that means something else entirely. 	5512

However, in this case the Axis would never formed: Hitler was very suspicious of Japan, and there would be no Germano-Japanese alliance.\"\"  I think it would be REALLY difficult. Still it cannot be said it would be impossible. I'm not saying that confractuations are facts, my goal is try keep this whole thing in the confractuation zone. Therefore mather of personal opinion only. You that are trying to put confractuations as facts.  And the use of \"\"Britain and the US never existed\"\" was too much in my view. They could simple have remained neutral while the Axis fought against the Soviets.   \"\"Regarding the Japanese decision not to attack the USSR (in Dec 1941 and Dec 1942), they did plan to do so in the case of major Soviet defeats under Moscow or Stalingrad. However, that hadn't happen, and the role of the Western allies was minimal in that. In addition, as some scholars believe, the Khalkhin Gol (Nomonhan) lesson was duly learnt by the IJA staff.\"\"  Minimal? Stalin loved the oil embargo that Roosevelt put in Japan. It could have been this very factor that saved his neck. The Japanese were a military government, and both the Army and Navy did put pressure for their attacks. The attack in the in the Pacific was purely desesperation. If Roosevelt didn't mather with the Soviets, it was just question to give the Japanese their oil and good will to put them against Stalin. However at this time the US was already allied with the Soviet cause. And I don't remember were I read now, but the US embassador even treath the Japanese embassador in a conversation if they launched an attack against the USSR.  About Nomonhan, the IJA staff learned some serious lessons on how to FIGHT the Soviets with it. The Army never give up of the idea of attack the USSR. Even the Navy had some simpaty for the cause if it's advance in the Pacific would not be halted. War between the two countries was probably inevitable. Get rid of the Communist treat was one of the largest security problems for Japan. Matsuoka's secretary comments this in the World at War Banzai episodie. He said: \"\"But when an integration against the north parted [oil] the Army naturally joined up with the Navy\"\". Obviosly, only for maintein the war in China and could fight the Soviets in the future because the critical resources needed.  Battle of the Bulge:   \"\"Please, clarify\"\"  Why you don't see the aspects of the battle from the Allied side?  Why the Soviets can loose like they did in Barbarossa and this be extremely analized by hypocrital \"\"intelectuals\"\" like you and the causes of one supossed less than expected performance the Western Allies not be?  Battles are won by several factors. Anacronism is not nice here. The Western Allies win in the Bulge. The Soviet sucess in Bagration for instance, was not garanteed when it was launched. It could had end up much worse than in the Bulge. With even defeat.  Re::: Lend Lease:  Yes, the Soviets could produce everything they needed. Look the link I posted above. The importance of the Lend Lease is well illustrated. Also, no Lend Lease, less material produced, more casualities for the Soviet side. They would resist this and the combined offensive of all the Axis powers? Pehaps, isn't? I'm just trying to point all this is something of impossible complexity, and therefore should be let in the field of personal opinions.   \"\"That means about 40,000 German tanks were not built'' And what crew was supposed to drive these tanks? Germany had a desperate situation with personnel, due to the Eastern front\"\"  Perhaps they wouldn't have if they could master their forces there from the start.   Also the money and the time spent with the subs could be used to solve many other problems, produced even more refined weapons, and this includes weapons of mass destruction.   I'm here to \"\"fight\"\" with you as long as I can. But one thing you already admit: you don't belive the USSR could hold all the Axis countries together. Repeating, I said this would be much difficult, but not impossible. Just don't want confractuations as truth.

0	\"  == I don't get it. ==  So if someone would be to travel through time, their actions would have no effect?  But time travel itself affects the past  you're taking something from the present and putting it in a different point in time, thus, for the context of the earlier point in time you travel to, introducing matter/energy/whatever that didn't exist there before, thus (as per chaos theory) possibly screwing up everything. Any successful travel through time would have an effect, otherwise it wouldn't be time travel.  With that in mind  does the principle boil down to \"\"time travel is only possible if it has no effect, thus time travel (the possibility of which necessitates having an effect) is not possible\"\"?  The matter and energy of which the time traveller (and his clothing, etc) consists would (if the universe is a closed system) have been in use by something else at an earlier point in time and thus a re-allocation of matter and energy already existent at that earlier point in time to recreate the time traveller doesn't seem to be a viable alternative either. But if the time traveller can neither be composed of matter and energy that didn't exist, nor of that which already existed but was \"\"in use\"\" already, what does he consist of?  Even if the universe is not a temporally closed system (i.e. matter/energy can vanish and re-appear at future points in time), for something to vanish in the present and re-appear in the past, it would have to vanish before its original appearance unless it can't exist twice at the same point in time (i.e. if atom A was sent back in time from a point Z to a point X, it would vanish at point Z (now) and appear at point X (back then) as A', but have to vanish again as time advances closer to the point Y (somewhere before point Z) where it was originally introduced as A, otherwise A and A' (which should be identical) would exist at the same point in time, which would definitely be an alteration of past events and thus incompatible with the principle.  I'm assuming the principle isn't based on the simplification of the idea that the only thing that \"\"matters\"\" is the action/inaction of humans (as in the interpretation of Schroedinger's experiment that the cat is in an unknown state where it is both alive and dead until the human interacts with it  which implies the human's perception determines the state of reality). If that is true, then the example from Twilight Zone where someone goes back in history to start the fire he travelled back in time to prevent is clearly contradictory as it introduces a paradox (a time travel having to have occurred in order for the time travel to occur) unless it actually changed the events (i.e. originally the fire would have been caused by something else), which would still be inconsistent with the principle which doesn't allow for any changes of the past.  I'm aware this post is getting a bit rant-y, but I'm seriously at a loss here. How does time travel NOT change the past, regardless of whether it has any consequences in the grand scheme of things or not? The very concept of travel backwards through time is that one appears at an earlier point of time, thus changing the past.  The only possibility I can think of for time travel not to change the past is a paradox in which the time travel happens because it has already occurred (i.e. the future representation (person A') of someone (person A) appears in the present and at some future point in time the same events cause person A to travel back in time that \"\"already\"\" caused person A' to go back in time, i.e. both of their time lines are identical), but in which there is no \"\"other\"\" time line in which the time traveller didn't already appear before travelling back in time (i.e. there is no time line in which person A travels back in time without person A' having travelled in time already, i.e. where person A doesn't eventually become person A', the time traveller).  All of this is obviously rendered null and void if the laws of physics are inconsistent and random stuff does appear out of thin air for no reason. —   ·  \"	5953

However, the principle of inertia is still an important and valid principle, and is the primary meaning of the term.

0	\"  **Opie, your statement \"\"You don't honestly believe that the author of the golf tee book is making things up\"\"…. is foolish. Many books and authors present fraudulent and construed information. Some of these authors print information that is researched haphazardly and sometimes not researched at all.  This is why reputable authors research and verify the content they use with Agencies that hold the fact-based and documented information. You consistently use the book The Singular History of the Golf Tee by Irwin R. Valenta, along with the website “Scottish Golf History” as a fact-based source. Looking at the website alone I find an abundance of erroneous and inaccurate information and patents. One just for example, is the U.S. patent of Mr. Dalziel in 1896. This patent, is claimed on the site as a “golf tee,” but in actuality is a device to be used in a game of Tennis and has no relation or bearing on the game of golf.  See patent #567,455 This is just one of the flagrant inaccuracies that are included in the links and information you have provided.  Another example of a site that has inaccurate information is Pat Ryan Golf timeline. It states that the Bloxsom & Douglas patent originated in 1899. Whether these “inaccuracies” are intentional or not, it is the lack of due diligence of the authors and originators that seems to be the issue.  Once corrected information has been verified and deemed accurate, upon the notification to the necessary parties, the erroneous information should be removed.  If it is not, then one is lead to believe that the misinformation by the author or originator is intentional.   All of the U.S. patents can be verified through the U.S. Patent office website. However, you say that the UK office has patents that are unsearchable through their website. It seems very suspicious that all of the patents that are quoted in the book seem to be “unavailable” through the UK patent office website for verification. \"	6167

In spite of the discussion, he edit-warred until the article got protected with his new edits inserted and the sourced text altered or removed.   \"	6241
0	\" January 2007 (UTC) *Francis, Of course I am open to the consensus of the group (any actual trads involved?).  However, I think your argument is misplaced. Mainstream Roman Catholicism at this time includes a broad cross-section of people with a wide variety of commitment levels, and yet all are considered \"\"Catholic\"\", so I do not think that one can simply compare trads in general with a subset of mainstream Catholics, which we might, for convenience, term \"\"hardcore.\"\"  In any event, my vision for this article in general, and for this section in particular, is to present an accurate picture of the persons discussed, who are traditional, or traditionalist Catholics.  Given that, it obvious that some things which are identified with them, such as praying the Rosary frequently or going to Confession often, will also be found among some, more commited, more devout mainstream Catholics.  To address your concerns, I am open to acknowledging in the article that this overlap exists.  However, I think that removing any reference in this article, in this section, to recitation of the Rosary is selling both somewhat short.  There are other things, as well, which could be added, such as a preference for homeschooling (which, again, would not be confined to trads, or even Catholics, but which, I would think, would correlate highly with a traditionalist position.  However, the question of the Rosary sort of gets to the heart of the matter.   00:22, 11\"	6244

0	\"  I am confused here.  I posted something about both of the publically funded Waldorf schools in Sonoma County, not an 'individual school,' and that information comes from official sources (so it is properly sourced), and the information provides information which contradicts the 'Official' Waldorf position.  I do not believe that the 'official' statement of the Waldorf committee reflects their reality.  Anti-immunization is so highly correlated with the Waldorf schools I have looked at as to be close to official policy.  Waldorf schools in the US  education as practiced in the US includes a substantial anti-immunization      == Concerns over immunizations ==  The current text refers to a 'consensus statement' which is a dead link.  This page http://www.waldorfanswers.org/QuestionsMore.htm refers to a growing anti-immunization movement within and outside of Waldorf schools, but again refers to the same dead link as the 'consensus statement' on vaccinations.  The article does not cite a verifiable source on the policy of Waldorf education towards vaccinations.  The article does say \"\"Studies have found Waldorf pupils to have a lower incidence of allergies and allergic-like symptoms, an effect which correlated with the extent to which they lived an \"\"anthroposophic lifestyle\"\" generally - in particular with reduced use of antibiotics, antipyretics, and measles, mumps and rubella vaccination\"\"  Which is a deep violation of NPOV - to assert a correlation when there is a deep selection bias in the cited studies.

Move complete Roose and Ramsey bios to minor characters. However, I think this particular article should be kept around for 2 reasons: 1. Simply put, it's a good idea to centralize information. Somebody who's reading minor houses and wants to read about Roose and Ramsey will find it easier and more intuitive to go to a House Bolton entry than a minor characters entry.  2. From all indications, the Boltons will be major players in ADWD (I think Martin saying that a Theon is coming back is better than mere \"\"speculation\"\"). Every major Westerosi institution that's had a POV centered on it (major houses, Night's Watch, Citadel) has an article. It seems pointless to get rid of this now and bring it back a year later.

0	This is the text about D. in 1911 Encyclopedia: *DOBRUDJA (Bulgarian Dobritch, Rumanian Dobrogea), also written DOBRUDSCHA, and DOBRUJA, a region of south-eastern Europe, bounded on the north and west by the Danube, on the east by the Black Sea, and on the south by Bulgaria. Pop. (1900) 267,808; area, 6ooo sq. m. The strategic importance of this territory was recognized by the Romans, who defended it on the south by Trajans Wall, a double rampart, drawn from Constantza, on the Black Sea, to the Danube. In later times, it was utilized by Russians and Turks, as in the wars of 1828, 1854 and 1878, when it was finally wrested from Turkey. By the treaty of Berlin, in 1878, the Russians rewarded their Rumanian allies with this land of mountains, fens and barren steppes, peopled by Turks, Bulgarians, Tatars, Jews and other aliens; while, to add to the indignation of Rumania, they annexed instead the fertile country of Bessarabia, largely inhabited by Rumans. After 1880, however, the steady decrease of aliens, and,the development of the Black Sea ports, rendered the Dobrudja a source of prosperity to Rumania.	6538

Some copyeditors have switched jobs, or are retired, or aren't sufficiently challenged, and wouldn't mind doing a little volunteer copyediting, and it would be nice to have more professionals in the mix.  If you're interested in doing more, great; if not, this is just an informal survey, and I'd appreciate your ideas on what would attract more professional copyeditors.  Dan	6631

On the one hand I had to save the life of Mr. Gandhi; on the other, I had to protect the legitimate rights of millions of my fellow untouchable brothers with the full value of my life. I had never thought that this double perplexing situation will be resolved so easily and successfully. I am very happy that all the Hindu leaders showed a great understanding and took a totally thoughtful and cooperative stance in the moment of this terrible and responsible situation so that we could arrive at a satisfactory solution to come out of this very complex situation. This could be possible only due to the struggle and vehement efforts made by Mahatma Gandhi for it. I was very surprised when Mahatma Gandhi accepted and gave assent to all my demands and even congratulated me. If he had adopted the same stand in the Second Round Table Conference, this difficult situation wouldn't have arisen. I am very happy to give acceptance and assent to this successful pact. If my Upper Caste brothers wholeheartedly accept and try to implement this pact, then I and my untouchable brothers would be very happy. On this occasion I do not hesitate to give credit to Sir Tejbahadur Sapru and C. Rajgopalachari besides Mahatma Gandhi for the success of this Pact.\"\" (Source: http://buddhambedkar.blogspot.com/2011/07/poona-pact-and-its-agreement.html)  Ambedkar's later, more mature, response, <> (Source: http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?281929)\"	6634

Second, I object the following: ::*the passage from the Russian table speaking of the Kievan Rus. As someone suggested earlier, that table should by any mean include a disclaimer explaining very loose ancestry between Kievan Rus and modern Russia. This is the main disputed claim (commented enough in other articles), unacceptable for me and several other Ukrainian and Belarusian users ::*Regardless of any \"\"Ukrainian military\"\" table, none of them may include the Red Army. This army was not only irrelevant to any of Ukrainian states (with very formal post-WWII exception), but also significantly anti-Ukrainian. For instance, Red Army units widely participated in war crimes against Ukrainian population and anti-Soviet guerillas. Creation of the \"\"Ukrainian\"\" table here has been a mere discussion trick not supported by all Ukrainian users. For instance, see earlier AlexPU's passage on \"\"trading the truth\"\"  ::Given all that, I'd suggest you to delete your first draft and find other ways for compromising.

Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies.   If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or \"\"db\"\" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

The mere mention of a Compulsory Liquidation even concerning Rangers FC 1872 appears to be a taboo subject. We will see what the happens at the BBC after their QC advised them to back Jim Spence's comments that the club died. The QC's advise is based on SCOTS'S LAW. Club died so how on earth can it still remain part of a redundant terminology.

0	\"  We seem to have a few issues under discussion at the same time here, and I think it would be helpful to separate them.     ===Maintaining \"\"old\"\" FAs=== As  said (00:14, 11 December 2008), this article was promoted to FA in 2006, when standards were less demanding, so work is needing to keep it close to current FA standard.  Unfortunately the \"\"committee\"\" process advocated by  doesn't work if the \"\"committee\"\" is slow to respond. In Oct 2006 I pointed out some serious scientific errors in Dinosaur, another \"\"old\"\" FA; nothing happened so in Jan 2007 I gave notice of my intention to fix these points; a few days later, after nobody objected, I fixed them; and a few days later the corrections were reverted, so that the article again contained the errors I'd pointed out 3 months earlier.      ===Quality of images=== This one has the potential to run for a long time. I have no strong objections to the image per se, but I'm not sure the article needs a reconstruction of a juvenile T rex'.     ===Selection of images=== Wikipedia is not a picture gallery, and images need to be used selectively. IMO if we have have plenty of images, as we appear to for dinosaurs, we  should use those that illustrate the content rather than just providing eye-candy. In many cases diagrams should take priority over pure pictures.     ===Size and placement of images=== There has been recent disussion of this at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style#Forcing Lead image (plus a more general Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style item that's now archived and I can't find it) and at Wikipedia talk:Accessibility#Image position. To sum up my own views: *Images that illustrate specific content should be alongside that content. *Layout of pages that use images has become more difficult as widescreen monitors have become more prevalent, as increasing the text width reduces the height of paragraphs, sections, etc. *I dislike left-floating images, as this makes the text less readable by changing the postion of the start of the next line, so that users have to search for it rather than jump to a familiar X co-ordinate. *The functions of images vary. Sometimes they convey a lot of detailed info, and a larger size than the default is needed. On other occasions they need give only a general impression of what something looks like, and a smaller size than the default is adequate. The majority of readers are unregistered and therefore cannot set preferences for image size or anything else. Hence editors have to pick image sizes that are appropriate for the purpose. *Accessibility to users with poor vision (but not functionally blind) is irrelevant, as they will either have their browsers set permanently on \"\"zoom in\"\" or have software that zooms in for all apps. * makes ugly gaps in the text and reduces the readability of articles. *IMO all these points indicate that MOS cannot dictate a \"\"one size fits all\"\" solution and editors should be free to set image sizes.   \"	6732

Basically to make a distinction officially, foreign relations deals with relation with other countries, diplomacy whereas military deals with armed forces, military stats, info ; military exercices etc... of similar kind and nature.  There is no country in the wiki which has termed 'Foreign relations and military' together in one heading. Neighboring countries like Japan, China, Pakistan, South Korea, USA, UK etc .... articles has formatted as such (Foreign relations and military - under two different title headings.   Under what circumstance, conditions, perception, economics and reality is Foreign relations and military termed under one heading and one section? I adhere and ammend to change this to different title i.e one is \"\"Foreign relations\"\" and the other is \"\"military\"\". Both title should have their own relevant materials not mixing up and making a ketchup article.  ::I commend each contributor who has contributed in growing and taking my suggestion to vastly improve the article.

In fact, if I recall correctly, you seemed perfectly happy with a number of such renames yourself: dare I say, until it started to impinge upon the geo-stubs.  Those aside, the number of cat names that aren't reasonable attributive usages (rather than necessarily adjectival, as I've pointed out more times than I care to remember) are not, I don't believe, as daunting as all that.  What is completely demoralising is to get part-way, and then to discover someone insisting that the old way was best, let's go back to that.

How can you archive something that was up for a matter of hours?  I have presented several factual arguments, and they were quashed almost instantaneously. This is not your own personal website to cover up the truth.  Evolution is not a fact. And before you go delete-happy again, answer any one of these points.  You say \"\"this article references evolution as an observable natural process and as the valid explanation for the diversity of life on earth.\"\"  Evolution has never been observed. Ever. Not one single transitory fossil, out of hundreds of thousands found from hundred of millions of years ago, not one has ever been found. Ever. Not one. No proof.  Fossils of mammals, found tens of millions of year ago, that look exactly like they do today. Through continental shifts, wild temperature changes, mass extinctions, floods, asteroids; they look exactly like they did from the beginning.  200 million year old lobsters look like 2 year old lobsters  There is no mention that gas does not clump in a vacuum, proving the big bang could not have happened, using the very laws of physics that you hold so close.  There is no mention that no one has ever observed a blue shift.  There is no mention that it's mathematically improbable for evolution to have occurred. No mention that human DNA is so incredibly complex it could not just have come in to being through pure chance.  There is no mention that not enough time has passed for cells to randomly have created the diverse life on earth.  There is no explanation of the Cambrian Explosion - only 1 phylum before, yet 13! afterward.  Evolution is a religion.\"	6876

0	==   ==  I am confused as to how I could have been bloked for Vandalisim. I have never vandilized anyones work. I hae edited pages because the original authors have put in factual errors or I have added things and sourced them. I edited the PIRA article, because Jdorney continues to revert it back to the un-factual article he orginally wrote. If Wikipedia is about accuracy, then I am confused as to why I would be banned from editing a un-factual article...particularly when I make sure to source my additions or changes. Everyone does this on Wikipedia, if I am going to be blocked for this...Jdorney should to, sine he does the same thing...or do editors get special treatment.  Another ridiculous complaint was made by SWATJester about the SAD article. The original SAD article was missing some facts, so I put facts from sources like Time Magazine, LA Times, Newsweek, and the New Yorker in. But I did not delete any of his work, I merely added to it...so I don't know whyu the guy is throwing such a little hissy fit. I have the right to edit just like everyone else, as long as I source my edits (which I always do). If people disagree with my edits, they can tell me in a grown-up professional way, or they can re-edit the article. I am more then willing to work with people on Wikipedia, but to be blocked for bogus reasons is a disgrace. I have obeyed the rules of Wikipedia, if I am doing something wrong, send me a message, and I will adress that. But I will not stop contributing to articles, that is the whole point of Wikipedia, if it bothers some editors like SWATJeaster and Jdorney...well, that's too bad, they need to get over themselves, and either fact check their articles, or make it so nobody can change them. It amazes me that these two are so petty that they block someone for doing the same things they do...pathetic.	7478

0	\"  Hey, I send that comment to Talk:Macedonian Slavs and I was just about to reply to you and to  when I suddenly went offline. As for your request for clearing out your name, I really don't know how to help? I mean, you are obviously in some quarrel with REX, I really don't know how to help there - you should probably both stop it, (regardless who's started it) and try to find a solution according to the NPOV policy. I have already stated my POV on the Arvanites dispute - I might be wrong, but it is probably better for me to stay away from the dispute. I think that REX's current version is quite OK. It includes what the vast majority linguists say: Arvanitika, is a variety of Tosk Albanian, and Arvanites' sensitivity towards the problem: Most Arvanites strongly dislike being called Albanians. I mean, it's not like saying that Arvanites are ethnic Albanians. For example: I cannot dispute the fact that most sources in the past referred to the Macedonian language, as a Bulgarian or a Serbian dialect, despite the fact that I believe that they were seriously wrong, and therefore there is nothing wrong with this sentence: Most sources in the past regarded Macedonian as a subset of the Bulgarian and Serbian language.  As for the block, I think that you're taking it too seriously. I haven't been blocked, but I have been ignored several times by some admins, although I've specifically requested not to be ignored (they could have at least said that: \"\"I don't want to get involved\"\" or smtg like that). My POV is that all the three blocks were somekind of a mistake (in the formal sense). I guess  acted in good faith, but chose the wrong means to convince you guys to finally stop PAs. I also think that  misunderstood REX's actions, as well, but he manages to live on -). That of course, is only my POV. But it is a fact that admins are humans as well.  As for the RfC, I don't see any particular reason to believe that neutrals will get involved in it all of the sudden. If they do, great. But if they don't, we cannot wait indefinitely.

0	\"  ==1820 Map vs Globe== The image in the infobox should be a geographic locator as well, showing where the state is within a larger context of the world. :It doesn't seem consistent with map of other Chinese dynasty articles (e.g. Ming, Tang, etc). Geographic locator map is mainly used for current country map (not historical map), e.g. People's Republic of China, United States, etc    ::The Qing Dynasty, although is a dynasty of the past, is also largely a modern political entity, and its history is intertwined with modern world history.  That's why I think a geographic locator is better suited, as it also mirrors the Republic of China (1912-1949) article.  Another thing to consider is that because there are so many contemporaneous maps of the Qing that's available (where as such maps are rare for prior historic dynasties, such as Ming and Tang), it is difficult to choose one that truly represent the whole article in the infobox.    ::I agree that showing all the different maps of the Qing Dynasty at its various extent and time periods is informative to readers, but they don't have to be in the infobox; a general geographic locator is a good fit there.

However, there are other areas of Wikipedia that would greatly profit from similar vigor. Take for instance the previously widely unknown National Capital Region (China). You rescued it from obscurity caused by a redirect. However, it must have escaped you that this article does not contain a single reference, and that there are several claims and outright speculations that deserve at least a dubious tag. A National Capital Region (China) is worthy of the same attention to detail as China’s capital, or other cities such as Shanghai. While it is the job of the author to provide these references (lest the author would risk a deletion), the lack of verifiable sources should at least have been pointed out. I have done so in the meantime. Thank you    :The only reason I rescued that article was because it was redirected to Bohai Economic Rim, which clearly is not the same thing as National Capital Region.

This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable.   If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or \"\"db\"\" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.  For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies.

0	\"  Wikipedia's founder, Jimmy Wales, has admitted that the much loved \"\"free encyclopedia\"\" has at least some quality problems. To some of us, this is nothing new. I've had more than one student rely on Wikipedia for accurate information for a paper, and it always ends up the same way: \"\"well, I got it off of Wikipedia, thinking it was good...\"\".  And therein lies the problem. If you keep in mind that anyone, and I mean anyone, can edit a Wikipedia entry, then you are treading on dangerous ground if you're going to cite it as a source of fact. While it's true that errors often get corrected, they don't always, and what happens in the meantime is that bad info sits there, misinforming people. Of course, this isn't true just in the case of Wikipedia. It's a problem online, in general. I recently was party to an argument over the historicity of Jesus, and one person used a source that claimed that Philo of Alexandria lived in Jerusalem. He's called Philo of Alexandria for a reason, you know.[]   I used to be such an unadulterated fan of Wikipedia you know. The idea of an open source online reference that grew on a daily basis was quite an attractive one back in the day. But in recent times I've become wary of the encyclopaedia anyone can edit, and not simply because of a few high profile choice edits.  Whatever about libel and congressional cherry picking amidst the many articles of this once noble enterprise, what really gets me about Wikipedia is that I can't trust it on most issues. There are so many agendas, axes to grind and purely mischievous vandals that 90% of what I would be interested in reading about - history, politics and so on - is tripe. To read an article on a contentious subject one can pick out bias, attempted compromise and ultimate failure almost immediately. Wade into the \"\"Talk\"\" page, where these edits are discussed, and you are confronted with chaos. There are too many vested interests at stake, and from the War on Terror to the Welfare State one will find an army of people taking one view or another entering into what are known as \"\"Revert Wars\"\", where they revert any edits back to the version which suits them.  From self-interest to political interest one can find \"\"POV\"\" (Point of View) shading almost every major article that touches on the live wires of our society. Thus I wouldn't trust anything that's even half-way current or ongoing on Wikipedia.  For one, the facts can be skewed. Secondly, the article can change overnight depending on how organised a campaign is launched against an article (and they do happen.)  []\"	7856

0	\"  ==Political question?== I not sure if this is \"\"political;\"\" and in fact, I'm hoping it is not ....    At WP:AN/I, you suggested a \"\"fresh start\"\" in the context of a discussion I have not followed.  My interest is only in that term  where did it come from?  This term does not appear to be associated with any Wikipedia conventions.  Fresh start (an anti-Maastricht Treaty group within the British Conservative Party opposed to the Maastricht Treaty) and Fresh Start (detergent) (a  Colgate-Palmolive laundry product) are unrelated.  If it's just a term you've introduced in this unique setting and nowhere else, fine.  I just wondered.  I attempted to use a similar concept in a military-related setting  at Talk:Hyūga helicopter destroyer#RESET, but it fell on deaf ears.  In retrospect, it seems likely that it would have made no difference if there had been a pre-existing link to Reset (military term); but perhaps it may make a difference in future.    The political question has to do with this military term.  How do \"\"depoliticize\"\" the article I'm about to create.  It seems likely that there may be numbers of editors and users for whom American military terminology becomes a priori political before it's even possible to reach the content threshold which implies something like your \"\"fresh start?\"\"    As a general rule, most of the new Wikipedia articles I've created have to do with pre-Meiji Japan, and this odd, overly-sensitive hesitation simply doesn't arise.  However, I'm not unaware of those critical voices on the francophone internet decrying the American bias in the World Wide Web; and I've noticed similar comments across a range of English-language Wikipedia articles.  Other than searching for British and Commonwealth military specialists in an effort to discover a congruent British and commonwealth term, can you think of something off-hand which might be relevant in creating an article which would have broader usefulness in Wikipedia contexts like you yourself created?  A further point: I really like the term \"\"fresh start\"\"  not as much as \"\"reset\"\".  Can you foresee any reason why I shouldn't re-name the article about the British activists in the 80's as Fresh Start (British politics).

0	\"  ===Each in turn===  #Suggested: In physics, force is the perceptible cause of the acceleration of a mass (change in the rate or direction of its motion) and is experienced as a push or a pull. instead of In physics, force is what causes a mass to accelerate experienced as a push or a pull. #:The addition of \"\"and\"\" is good. However, a force need not be \"\"perceived\"\" to exist. The definition of \"\"acceleration\"\" is indeed confusing to the lay person, but I think that the wikilink on acceleration covers it. We need to be careful to not go overboard in description in the lead. #Provide definition: \"\"momentum (quantity of motion)\"\" #:Hmm, this isn't exactly an accurate definition of momentum since momentum is, in fact, both mass and motion. Again, the wikilink I think should suffice, but maybe we can reword things without providing definitions to make it clearer. I want this to be intelligible, but I'm afraid that including these points might be confusing for many and an annoyance to even more. #Following the development of quantum mechanics, it is now understood that momentum is a fundamental property of particles and that, according to the standard model of particle physics, changes in momentum are the consequence of the net emission or absorption by particles of momentum-carrying gauge bosons. Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a \"\"force\"\" are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these boson-mediated fundamental interactions. In modern physics, only four fundamental interactions are known; in order of decreasing strength, they are: strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational.[1] High-energy particle physics observations in 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a unified electroweak interaction. No gauge boson has yet been demonstrated for mediating the gravitational interaction and what is perceived as the \"\"force\"\" of gravity is more accurately attributable to the the effect of distortions by massive bodies of the curvature of spacetime as explicated in Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. #:There is a slight issue here with the sentence: \"\"Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a \"\"force\"\" are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these boson-mediated fundamental interactions.\"\" This sentence misses the fact that forces also exist on the micro level. A single boson-mediated fundamental interaction often has a \"\"force\"\" associated with it. For example, an electron accelerates because it emits a photon: this is due to the electromagnetic force acting on the electron. One micro-interaction: still a force since a mass accelerated.  I will implement the wording I think is good, but let's keep discussing the problematic wording.    \"	8018

0	\"  Well it looks like you others who have an account added the rat factoid, what with it explaining the ending.  Scorpion, as to your last edit of Dominik about changing 'the line' to the rat, what was meant was that the last line of this episode referes to the symbolisism of the rat in the last scene of the film. I can't edit anything so hopefully you folks can solve this yourself.  And Dominik, per your own hypothetical scenario, if in fifty years from now someone does watch the episode, wouldn't they be confused as to the last moment.  It's not a question of explaining a joke, it's a question of elucidating an unclear ending.  The former can be superfluous, the latter is necessary.  Finally, and this is towards Ctjf83 and Momusufan, I freely admit that I am no expert about the bureaucratic nature of and rules of this site.  But I'm guessing double standards, wrongful accusations and automatic mistrust goes against the spirit and the letter of the rules here.  This is why I asked an administrator to look at the situation in regards to the rules and whether I or you overstepped any of them and any suggestions of way to rectify this matter, and was not, as you falsely imply, to give an opinion about the inclusion of the line itself.  This is all moot since this fact is now in the article despite your vociferous attempts to block it.  In all likelyhood, were I a registered user, this would have never been an issue and my edit would have remained.  It's quite a hypocritical paradox that anonymous users who are more ignorant of the requirements in editing an article are held to a higher standard than those users familiar with them.  But then I'm guessing that in \"\"the encyclopedia anyone can edit\"\" which represents \"\"the sum of human knowledge\"\" it is not acceptable and you two for whatever personal reasons, chose to ignore those very concepts that you clame to profess and want others to follow.  \"	8030

0	\"  :::: novaseminary pov pushing,and section blanking.  So everyone is aware of his pov editing, I have copied some of his history here.  I ask other editors not to restore his versions as they are pov and section blanking. Here is a little histoy on novaseminry. More can easily be found. I include it here to show the type of editor he is.   Request topic ban of User:Novaseminary for persistent disruptive editing at Douglas Tait (stuntman)   User:Novaseminary has tried unsuccessfully to get the Douglas Tait (stuntman) BLP deleted twice before. Here, and here. But having failed at deletion twice, for two years now, Novaseminary has also failed at WP:LETITGO. He persistently challenges the BLP's notability and threatens to start a 3rd deletion attempt. He also regularly violates WP:DE. He edit wars and disruptively edits almost on a daily basis, pushes POV, attacks other articles because they are mentioned in the BLP, creates suspect disambig stubs, insists on irrelevant or dated edits, violates OR, uses citation tags to edit war, like here, here, here and here, removes sourced quotes and attacks and fights to include and spreads unflattering and irrelevant material about the BLP's subject over several editor's objections.   But Novaseminary is also knowledgeable of WP rules. So knowledgeable that he uses WP to argue & defend his indefensible actions, even as he ignores all the WP rules & policies that his tendentious editing violates. He cites the rules that give him cover, and just ignores those that expose his tactics as disruptive. Recommend an immediate topic ban. Not just for the Douglas Tait (stuntman) BLP, but for all the articles sourced in the BLP. Otherwise he will just retaliate by continuing to disrupt them. 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:A449:F5CE:8339:FCA2 (talk)   This looks like a content dispute. Have you taken this to WP:DRN as a first port of call? Ritchie333 (talk) (cont)  Unfortunately, it's more than a content issue. It's a persistent, long-term pattern of disruptive behavior. So per WP:DDE, ANI \"\"may be the best first step.\"\" 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:A449:F5CE:8339:FCA2 (talk)  The article would probably benefit from both these editors leaving it alone. Drmies (talk)  Fact is, unless admins enforce it, don't count on it. Otherwise I wouldn't have had to come here. I've suggested several times that Novaseminary just take a Wikibreak from the article. He refused. 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:3533:DED5:47AA:B44 (talk)     I found this at WP:RFPP and have spent more time than I'm willing to admit looking through it all. 3RR violations from dynampic IPs are really disruptive, but similarly I think we can do without Noveseminary's bizarre obsession with this person. I'm going to give Novaseminary time to respond, but I strongly lean towards a topic ban for both users. – Steel   You know what? I'll accept that. If Novaseminary is topic banned, I'll voluntarily self-ban. My only request is that the last edit before the ban is monitored/reviewed by uninvolved 3rd party/parties to insure no Novaseminary POV. Thanks. 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:3533:DED5:47AA:B44 (talk)  I've never violated a single guideline or policy at this article. The IP seems to care more about how this person is presented favorably than about the nietrality of WP, but it tough to know what else if anything this IP has edited. This article was one of several resume-like PR/POV articles i've come across over the years. I, and others, tried to make it neutral and then kept it on my watchlist. Almost everything i've done i've discussed at talk. I have only even edited this over the last few weeks because an IP came along and removed well sourced text without discussion until posted at a NB. Novaseminary (talk)  I would also point out, I only nominated this article for deletion once, with no consensus. I actually came across it at the first successful AfD nom made, not by me, but another editor. The IP seems to think I have had it out for this person, but I have been only one of several editors to do things the IP apparently disapproves of, but that I think comply with policy. (At one point the article cited several non-RS articles written by a single publicist, for instance.) Novaseminary (talk)  Our IP user has agreed to a self-ban from this article providing you do the same. From your comments above that the IP's edits are the only reason you've even been editing the page recently, this should be an acceptable resolution for you too. Right? – Steel  Yes. Novaseminary? I do agree that you have an all-too strong interest in that article. Drmies (talk) 17:16, 13 October	8341

I meant that the things were fine than, but on 8 December 2005 FreestyleFrappe again removed all my additions.  I’m trying to understand that everybody has different view on the same thing, but still I cannot understand how somebody wants to describe Kumanovo with the following paragraphs: Econony, Violence, Narcotics!?

0	\"  == re:  ==  re: (My talk) First off: please don't get mad at me for what I say below. I say it in good faith, and most likely a naive view.  It seems to me that you're going about interwiki-linking to the other wikimedia sites in an overly complex way. Wouldn't something along the same style as the inter-language wikipedia links (i.e. in the bar on the left of the page) be far better, and much more elegant? Not only would it reduce the amount of clutter on the page, it would also remove any issues with categories being named differently as the interlanguage links deal with this as a routine matter. Additionally, there are a number of bots that would be able to propagate these interwiki links (i.e. you'd add one set of links on, say, Wikipedia, and a bot could propagate them to all of the other sites).  I can see two issues with this: 1. it requires developer changes to the mediawiki code, 2. it's not possible to use tracking categories. Hopefully the first one of these shouldn't be too difficult to arrange, and if inter-wikimedia-ing becomes popular, I think that the benefit of the tracking categories is fairly minimal.     ... or am I misunderstanding what you're doing? The above works nicely if you're just linking similar templates together, and even if you're making sure that they have similar functionality. However, if you're making sure that all of the templates _are exactly the same_, it's not so good. In this case, a system like that used at Help:Link would be better - having a single master copy (the best place I can see for this is on the meta), which is then copied over to all of the mediawiki wikis every so often. That copying could be done by a bot, say every 24 hours, with the template being flagged for human attention if it's been modified anywhere but on meta. Of course, extra care would then have to be taken if the template calls were modified.  ''  ::Mike I be putting this whole section in WT:TSP, but the short answer is first that I concluded last fall this belongs on Meta, and much of our 'good stuff' is already there and many of our best template programmers contribute there as well (Omegatron, CBD, etc.) But here people know me and so this is where it began. Like David, RL called (demanded!) and I went wiki-missing much of last fall, and was busy with mediation stuff when I first returned to having regular time for wiki's, then iterwikitmp-grp hit Tfd... so that boot in the rear restarted things. I'd really rather be working on categorization between here and the commons! Sigh... life is not a selection of first choices, most of the time we're lucky to be able to get one selection in our top fifteen!  I'll address your points on WT:TSP. But thanks for the interest and input. I like that idea of intersister interwiki's! As for 'What I'm doing', the WP:TSP has new revision that may help communicate the focus as I see it. This is really a local need as much as one off in the smaller sister's though Wikispecies and Wikiversity much need template expertise and libraries.  ttfn //  \"	8394

0	:::: The problem with any use of the word 'informer' is that it is pejorative and used as an heinous insult in Irish republican circles. Informers are thus bad people, but usually people who are in some way treasonable. This makes the word's use completely inappropriate in relation to the Dunmanway massacre as none of those killed had any loyalty to the IRA. They may well have been close to the security forces (RIC or army) and helped them but this is what they were brought up to do.  A neutral (NPOV) phrasing might be that they would probably have assisted the RIC and army or been informants. Their killings however had much more to do with vengeance (for the O'Neill shooting) than a coherent attack on 'informers' as republicans would have seen them.   	8409

You made some good points, but the request's supporters made better ones. Your opposing vote contained the following text: ::Furthermore, the reason given for moving is in itself offensive. The title is objective, and the objection to it seems to be only that it doesn't adequately conform to Laval's own beliefs about what is motivating the contributors to this article. In the absence of any evidence that we're bigots, I suggest the correct move is for Laval either to demonstrate we're bigots or to apologize for slandering us. ::This violates WP:AGF in the first sentence, and continues to be something akin to a personal attack. I am sure that your comments were sincere, but I think both sides allowed themselves to get riled and to speak too rashly. Your point about original research was more significant, but the term \"\"Anti-Quebec sentiment\"\" does seem to be in fairly widespread use (I did check). ::A person doesn't have to vote to voice an opinion. The instructions at the top of every poll state \"\"Please remember that this survey is not a vote\"\", so the fact that I've inferred opinions from other parts of the debate is not a problem. It seems that 205.157.110.11 (an IP, but one with a very strong history of contructive edits) would have made an explicit vote were it not for the hot-headed wording of the proposal, and GTBacchus (an editor who I have yet to see make a mistake) also supported a very similar title. Laval, the move's proponent supported his move, of course; tjstrf proposed an alternative title, which garnered little support, and \"\"Marc Gévry\"\" commented more on the debate than the title. This makes 3 \"\"votes\"\" in favour of \"\"Anti-Quebec sentiment[s]\"\", and one (yourself) directly opposed. Characterising votes for alternative titles as either support or opposition for the quoted proposal cannot be accurately done, so I omitted those from the count (but took them into consideration for the decision, of course). ::I don't approve of returning to debates once they've been closed, and I really think you should move on.

0	\"  ::And what do \"\"quanta\"\" and \"\"cosmology\"\" have in common?  Energy.  To simply categorize physics as \"\"the study of everything\"\" is imperceptive.  When modeling sand falling into a pile (or nuts sorting in a jar) a physicist doesn't really care about the identity of the particles at hand, just certain \"\"bulk\"\" properties that relate to its energetics.  The chemist tries to understand how the material composition in turn generates those energetic qualities, but then usually isn't capable of formulating the dynamic description of what happens when it's shaken (or spilled).  A physicst usually could care less about why niobium is better for a collider than copper, just that it is.  And chemists don't just care about chemical elements and compounds, there is a whole field of chemistry dedicated to monitoring interactions of nuclei with nucleons (nuclear chemistry)  still matter.  As a point of culture, chemists tend to focus on the diversity of matter and how that affects interactions with energy and physicists focus on the unity of energy, and how that affects matter.  Physical chemists very nicely bridge this  they put quite a bit of energetics while still caring deeply about the identity of that which is being studied.  While the duality may sound a bit contrived, there is definitely some truth to the statements, and while not perfect, it's more meaningful than what's there now.\"	8687

0	\" ==Part II - Sources inside the New Testament== Now I am working on those sources that make up the Christian Canon.   ===Gospel of Matthew=== Here I am running into the same difficulty as I did at the Gospel of the Hebrews. I have now completed my review of WP policy on duplication. It appears to me that Ictu may be using duplication as a cover for POV pushing. Over the past several weeks he has visited many many many articles and removed all material from Edwards, Parker, Nicholson, Butz etc.   However, there are some legitimate Duplication concerns.  The problem is that sources explain that during the formative years of Early Christianity 75 ancient witnesses testify to the fact that there was a Hebrew Gospel in circulation. Google Link Over 12 different witnesses testify that it was written by the Apostle Matthew. Google Link No ancient writer either Christian or Non-Christian challenges these two facts. Google Link   Nicholson, Parker, Edwards, Bütz and others agree with Jerome. Thus the Hebrew Gospel is the basis for a number of topics. How do we go back to the fountainhead without duplicating material? The matter is further complicated by the fact that the Catholic Church and a number of scholars believe that Jerome was wrong and that the Gospel of Matthew in the Bible was written by Matthew.  As a sign of good faith I have removed most of the material objected to until we work out a solution.       ==Comments== ====Two Ways==== I offer a simple observation, born of my personal experience. There are TWO WAYS (see the Didache).  One path leads to assumptions of WP:AGF on the part of all editors and a focus on improving article content.  The other path, the dark path, leads to arbitration.  Once you start down the path of poisoning the well, you will end up drinking deeply from its water.  Hang in there.    ::Thanks for the kind words. My problem is that although I have a strong grasp of the sources and references, I am truly dim witted when it comes Wiki-warring techniques. I need admin help to allow me to focus on the scholarship. -     While we're talking generalities, my further observation is that I don't think you understood my \"\"blending\"\" point about NPOV.  Trying to judge and weigh sources often leads to unintentional synthesis, which is forbidden.  Even experienced editors often do not understand this point, and attempt to suppress POVs that are, in their opinion, out of favour, to the detriment of the readers.  As I said, all significant views should be represented.  From your response I'm not clear that you understood that.  If you did, my apologies. I would hate to see you sanctioned in any way (and this is not a threat from me, BTW, but an observation about what others may do), but you need to familarise yourself more with the Wikipedia policies, or else you are likely to be be reported at ANI with undesirable consequences. It takes awhile to get into the Wiki-style. If another editor reprimands you, claiming that you are in breach of policy, it would be a good idea to presume that they are correct for the next 6 months or so. There is a lot more to policy than just avoiding content forks.  For instance, reacting to an edit war by reverting is not the answer, but would be judged as edit warring itself if you were reported.  And that's the sort	8795

0	\"  (outdent) How about looking at it like this. RPG rulebooks are just that. The rulebook explains how to play the game, but it is not the game itself. The ISBN manual you reference below supports this; games \"\"SHALL NOT\"\" be given ISBNs. There may be some confusion in the matter, but one good example is found by harking back to AD&D; 2nd Ed. To play that game required (it being rules heavy, that really is pretty much true) a minimum of two books—the DM Guide and the Players' Handbook. Neither \"\"contained\"\" the game, and the game went far beyond what was in either. The game in all its entirety encompassed the contents of many books, magazine articles, supplements, pamphlets, online articles and what was in the head of the players. The book is about the game; it is not the game.    For that matter, a number of the articles you tagged did not list an ISBN, so you can't really claim that you claimed it was a book in ignorance because of the ISBN. A publisher doesn't mean it's a book, as board games, computer games, and any number of things are published and have publishers.    \"	8944

Web. . While Wikipedia's editor gender gap is important but difficult to measure, its biographical gender gap can more readily be measured. We correlate a Wikipedia-derived gender inequality indicator (WIGI), with four widespread gender inequality indices in use today (GDI, GEI, GGGI, and SIGI). Analysing their methodologies and correlations to Wikipedia, we find evidence that Wikipedia's bias in biographical coverage is related to the gender bias in positions of social power.  *Kalla, Joshua L., and Peter M. Aronow. \"\"Editorial Bias in Crowd-Sourced Political Information.\"\" PLOS ONE PLoS ONE 10.9 (2015): n. pag. Web. . In this paper, we examine what kinds of biases exist in crowd-sourced information on Wikipedia. Because any user can also be an editor, no one person with any particular ideological or partisan motivation should be able to control Wikipedia. Yet scholars have recognized the tension that comes from distributed, crowd-sourced platforms like Wikipedia. On the one hand, crowd-sourced information platforms create opportunities for citizens to challenge media-driven narratives. On the other, these platforms may be captured by the self-interested who have the greatest motivation to shape them for their own benefit.  ==mass media==  * Many hands make Wikipedia work.

It's hard to avoid. On just about any Google search, Wiki tops the list. Because it's also astoundingly comprehensive, intelligible and reliable, it has become the ubiquitous go-to start point. Yet almost the first research rule our kids learn is Wiki-denial. Read it if you must but, never, honey, never ever admit to it. ... So yes, Wikipedia is flawed. Above all, it needs more female input. But the obvious response, for you-and-me users who encounter something stupid or biased or just plain wrong, is to hop in there and fix it.

The National Retrieved from http://ezproxy.sfpl.org/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1515588882?accountid=35117 Prof Bruckner's hope is that having systemic data on the extent and reasons behind bias could mobilise resources to deal with the issue. It might help, she suggests, if universities encouraged staff to become Wikipedia contributors, ensuring important academic work does not get ignored. They could, for example, expand the programmes some of them already run for academics on writing newspaper editorial columns - another area where female writers tend to be heavily outnumbered - to cover Wikipedia contributions. \"\"That is not something we usually do. We're scientists, we're not in the business of marketing our research. We have no training to do this,\"\" said Prof Bruckner. She admits she has never contributed to Wikipedia herself. The apparent bias could also be partly redressed by focusing on general initiatives to improve Wikipedia's quality. For Prof Bruckner, the Wikipedia project may also offer pointers about how the value of academic work in general is assessed. \"\"There is the gender issue, but also how people think about scholarship and what's reputable scholarship or not,\"\" she said.\"	9102

It's infuriating, when people edit, not only ruining the format but changing the years (Beware the Night to be specific, as it is slated for 2015 not 2014) and trying to advertise his work on the page. I will continue to uphold his page. Every movie that is on his list can be directly referenced to IMDB, I do not accept the use of his earlier short films because there are no references, no proof and no information that would exonerate such claims. I am going to uphold the site, and will refrain from my profanity. I don't even know who's editing the page, but it's seriously making me angry.	9207

I actually signed up to Wikipedia Review the other day, as the public forums didn't contain any outings that I could see for myself, and even in the private forums I couldn't find any information that hadn't already been published elsewhere. Why on earth would I follow rules that I don't agree with? Especially rules that were formed as part of an ArbCom ruling that had no idea what would happen a few months later. I don't really care if we're not allowed to link to WR in other namespaces, but when this idiocy spills over into the mainspace the only purpose it will serve is to make us look like spiteful navel-gazers to the general public. Will the average reader of Essjay controversy care if WR 'outs' editors? I doubt it (and in my opinion, it doesn't anyway). Will they be interested in finding out how the revelations began? I think so.

I am a Latin teacher and I would expect the pronoun expressed in an English rendering since it's clearly expressed in the Latin. The \"\"literal\"\" translation implies that Latin doesn't mark person and number on verbs, which is of course false. Now that I look at the other examples it looks like this problem pervades the article. Someone is trying to \"\"recreate\"\" the effect of such languages (I call them pro-drop) in English. The problem is that you can't create the effect in English, which is one of the points of the article, i.e. English is not a null-subject language!

0	\" ::: Binky, grow up. All you want is to be obstructive and destructive of real info included on WP - you're solidly outed. You might as well admit it. At least to yourself. Over here you write: \"\"You know, I like your Strauss-Kahn addition, using good sourcing, but this bit about bootlegs is your weak area. You need to find a source that says that Fogerty's music can be found on bootlegs\"\": that being so, why don't you do it yourself, and thus help additions those less skillful at manipulating WP than you, try to contribute? Instead of actively deleting and obstructing the info being included, under increasingly fanciful pretexts (incidentally, \"\"source that says that Fogerty's music can be found on bootlegs\"\" is easily found on Youtube and elsewhere, e.g. http://www.freetimeweb.nl/home/muziek/ccr/johnfogerty_bootleg.html (I'm sure even you can google \"\"Fogerty bootleg\"\", though actually I didn't add that info - I only supplied the ref, before you deleted it all). But you deleted it or had it deleted, instead of supporting it with adjustments, as you could've done, improving instead of obstructing - how's that for an idea?). You appear to be an amateur psychopat, taking out your failed real life on innocents on WP. You a-soul. Be a good person. Instead of being destructive and obstructive, be constructive. If you know how - if not, try to learn. Even a miserable psychopat like you can turn around. Try. - Plus, incidentally, I haven't been edit-warring but reverting your edit-warring and vandalism (check history if you suddenly don't recall - but your memory is tendentially selective, I'm sure, recalling only that which supports your lies, right?). I'm no expert at WP and have no time to become one - I only wanted to contribute, not to get embroiled with an apparent psychopat like you. Plus re new IPs: if frequent power-outages happen to change my IP, don't flatter yourself that it's in response to your unacceptable behaviour: you're not on par with hurricane Nina. At all. You're merely a small gust temporarily confusing, but achieving nothing - except making people tire of you. You really are a tiresome fogey, as demonstrated when you write and admit: \"\"despite the truth of what you were inserting\"\". Well, that truth being so, why don't you help fix it, instead of hounding away the contributor? But you apparently don't think facts should have primacy on WP, rather your quarrelling should, right? - I'm no expert on the rules you misuse, and won't waste time to become one - as I have a real life. I merely contribute where I can, as an attitude to life. Try it. You might like it. Actually -). Instead of perfecting being an apparent grumpy old man and failed psychopat, scouring WP for victims. You won, because I'm not interested in your fight. Now you've successfully excluded good info from WP, info which even you concede is \"\"the truth\"\". That's a pyrrhic victory if ever there was one. Hope this little letter changes you for the better, because that's truly needed. Try it: Help info get on to WP, instead of picking quarrels by deleting what even you call \"\"the truth\"\". Focus on getting correct info on to WP, instead of getting lost in \"\"the system\"\". - That's just an idea, but think it over. It might do you good. Get well soon. Bye now.

It is also against the Hippocratic Oath; which states: \"\"Do no harm.\"\" Circumcision is harmful to infants and the men that they will become. A circumcision itself takes 1/3 to 1/2 of the male shaft skin on the penis. It also takes over 2000 fine touch nerve sensors, the gentle gliding mechanism that is offered by the foreskin, and the protection of the foreskin itself. It causes unnecessary pain to the infant and the anesthesia does not block all the pain that an infant feels. In 1993, a ban was formed against genital cutting of infant females. Under the law the ban should also cover male infants too as the equal protection act states. It's time for all sexes to be protected from this barbaric practice.

I thought  it was interesting since I am sure there  are more and that shows a vital field of research. However I take issue with associating Santilli, with fraud, kook, fringe  and I am sure that it is against the rules of Wikipedia on libel and reckless behavior with the clear intent to damage since the fringe scientist definition is not supported by anything of value,  except, perhaps some blogs and  tabloids which, according to the rules, have no source value since they are not peer-reviewed articles!

0	January 2014 (UTC)   Just a further reply to the editor, 71.234.215.133, who pointed out Wikipedia policy on bolding. I think this editor was quite genuine with me and fair minded. I think also this editor sounds like they respect Wikipedia rules. As soon as this editor sent me a message I apologized for my genuine error. I also did not continue to use bold text anywhere. I had genuinely thought that this was okay, as I have seen it elsewhere with more experienced editors. Can only learn. And change editing behavior. My opinion is that once something like that is pointed out, if an editor reads the Wikipedia guidelines and then abides by them, and it was a genuine good faith error, like it was with me, I think an editor should given some credit. But hey.  06:52, 17	9617

Graphic novels reach back to the Victorian era.  It's neither one of the first graphic novels, nor even one of the first modern era graphic novels, nor even one of he first super hero themed graphic novels.  I can think of no level on which that late 70s graphic novel is in any way a first for the field of graphic novels, aside from being a reltively early one (though not first) for Marvel comics as a publisher.

0	\"   Wikipedia is not the place to publish original research.  Wikipedia will only give a \"\"balanced view\"\" if such a view can be supported with citations from published literature, preferably peer-reviewed scientific literature.  Equally important, Wikipedia is a reference encyclopedia that has an obligation to note that this hypothesis is not currently accepted by any mainstream, reputable medical organization (CCHR doesn't count, as they are neither reputable nor are they a medical organization).    Perhaps, instead of attempting to convince the Wikipedia audience as to the veracity of these claims, you would be better off attempting to publish research and convince scientists and researchers of the validity of these claims using evidence.  You mention that you are a psychologist.  I do not know about psychologists across the pond, but in the US, the American Psychological Association, the specialty society that represents and speaks for American psychologists, has been quite clear in stating their support for the mainstream view that ADHD represents a serious neurological behavioral problem.  The American Psychological Association has also not endorsed this Social Construct hypothesis, and many of their statements contradict this hypothesis.  In fact, the APA even has a page set up specifically for ADHD: http://www.apa.org/topics/topicadhd.html  Now, as I mentioned, I am not as familiar with practice in the UK, but I did manage to find the NICE clinical practice guidelines for ADHD.  They can be found here: http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG72FullGuideline.pdf  In any event, the problem has nothing to do with anyone being \"\"wedded\"\" to any notion, but rather that the proponents of this hypothesis have published very little research and have so far failed to convince the vast majority of researchers in their field as to the merits of their proposal.  First must come the research, the evidence, independently verifiable information that can be cited to support the hypothesis.  That must come first, before you can expect to see any sort of \"\"balanced view.\"\"\"	9651

0	\" :: The non-numeric precedent was set by Template:Max/4, where I think the likelihood is that users will have \"\"n/a\"\" text entries when more, but the use of expensive #iferror will limit {max/5} to 100 instances (5*100=500 expensive limit). Yet, it is also likely to be used few times in an article; however, I was thinking \"\"maxnum/5\"\" for a pure quick numerical maximum. I have not seen much improvement from Lua speed, and of course, the extra {#invoke:} accessor templates will irritate people. Meanwhile, we have millions of templates, such as 100,000+ infoboxes. So, I think we just need more basic template parser functions, such as {#length:string}, {#numeric: data}, and yes, {#set:val|70*5} to set parameter values mid-stream (like a \"\"real\"\" language), rather than calling another template to pass val=70*5. As for the expansion depth, experienced programmers are more likely to exceed the limit, due to typical if-else-if-else-if-else logic, and bottom-line, the 40-limit expansion is just way too low for modern computers, which use perhaps, 200 if-else nesting, easily, where perhaps a limit of 60 would solve most problems now.

0	\"  Dear Non Curat Lex  According to Wikipedia \"\" The criterion for validity of a legal rule in such a society is that it bears the warrant of the sovereign and will be enforced by the sovereign power and its agents.\"\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_positivism  You are using the term \"\"legal rule\"\" to describe \"\"Laws and organizations charged with regulating judicial conduct may also impact pro se litigants. For example, The State of California Judicial Counsel has, through published materials addressed the need of the Judiciary to act in the interests of fairness to self-represented litigants. [5] The California rules express a preference for resolution of every case on the merits, even if it requires excusing inadvertance by a pro se litigant that would otherwise result in a dismissal. (While this creates double standardyour unsupported unflagged statement), The Judicial Counsel justifies it based on the idea that \"\"Judges are charged with ascertaining the truth, not just playing referree... A lawsuit is not a game, where the party with the cleverest lawyer prevails regardless of the merits.\"\"[6] It suggests \"\"the court should take whatever measures may be reasonable and necessary to insure a fair trial\"\" and says \"\"There is only one reported case in the U.S. finding a judge's specific accommodations have gone too far\"\".  Do you mean that \"\"the court should take whatever measures may be reasonable and necessary to insure a fair trial\"\" \"\"will be enforced by the sovereign power and its agents.\"\"?  Why are you describing my insertion of the following 13 citations as \"\"controversial edits\"\" and what difference does it make that it is controversial? Wikipedia is supposed to be able to deal with controversial subjects such as presidential elections.  Did you find the references to be inaccurate?  Why exactly did you delete the following?  \"\"The wording \"\" which requires a judge to “accord to every person who has a legal interest in a proceeding . . . the right to be heard according to law.” is used in many state codes including Alabama,  Canon III a 4 http://www.alalinc.net/jic/docs/cans2006.pdf  Idaho, Canon III a 7http://www.judicialcouncil.idaho.gov/code.pdf  Indiana, Canon III b 8http://www.in.gov/judiciary/rules/jud_conduct/index.html   Kentucky,  Canon III a 7 SCR 4.300http://www.sunethics.com/kycodejudconduct.htm  New Jersey,Canon III a 6 http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/rules/appendices/app1_jud.htm#P29_2525, NevadaCanon III b 7 http://www.leg.state.nv.us/CourtRules/SCR_CJC.html Wisconsin  SCR 60.4 g http://www.wicourts.gov/sc/rules/chap60.pdf.Pennyslvania,  Canon III a (4) http://www.pacode.com/secure/data/207/chapter33/chap33toc.html Virgina,  Canon III a 7http://www.courts.state.va.us/jirc/canons_112398.html#canon3  Rhode Island,  Canon III a 7 http://www.courts.state.ri.us/supreme/jtd/code.pdf  Washington State,Canon III a 4 http://www.cjc.state.wa.us/Gov_provision/code_canons.htm' West VirginiaCanon III a 7 http://www.state.wv.us/wvsca/JIC/Codejc.htmUtah,  Canon III b 8http://www.law.uh.edu/Libraries/ethics/Judicial/judiccanons/canon3.html   Why did you insert the qualifier \"\"while this creates a double standard\"\" and not flag it?  My understanding is that all a court will do is make sure the rules are understood.  As clear in the reference, if a complaint should be dismissed because of statute of limitations, for instance, there is no difference between the results based on whether it is filed by a lawyer or not.  I see no Wikipedia justification for your choice to delete the state judicial canons, even if Risker and Arthur Ruben also want them deleted.  By saying that the state judicial canons are \"\"controversial edits\"\" you are admitting that they are \"\"relevant\"\".  Just what are you threatening to do \"\"as appropriate action\"\" because I flagged your unsupported statements and reinserted the 13 references to the state judicial codes?    \"	10119

There is consensus.  I think this sums it up very nicely:  \"\"The last known use of the Mk V in battle was by units of the Red Army during the defence of Tallin against German forces in August 1941. The four Mk Vs previously operated by Estonia were used as dug-in fortifications. It is believed that they were subsequently scrapped.\"\"  \"\"In 1945, Allied troops came across two badly damaged Mk V tanks in Berlin. Photographic evidence indicates that these were survivors of the Russian Civil War and had previously been displayed as a monument in Smolensk, Russia, before being brought to Berlin after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941.[6] Accounts of their active involvement in the Battle of Berlin have not been verified.\"\"  Fletcher is wrong about the number of vehicles, but the facts about them can be established separately. Assumptions about them cannot. We can establish 1941, but not 1945.  (Btw, at Tallin two of the Estonian vehicles moved under their own power, and two were towed into position.

0	\" Unfortunaately, I don't know of such books. By the way, the Guardian quite was brought up in the original deleteion discussion but was disregarded, though the Guardian is a significant British newspaper.  It might be releavent to mention that this Mr. yellow Up seems to have a consistent policy of hounding me and trying to get rid of whatever I write which does not fit his political opinions, he does it also in the Hebrew Wikipedia.  There are some more points which I thought of. The argument of Yellow Up that \"\"This is just one of thousands of trials against military evaders\"\" which was rpeated by Danntm \"\"just a simple, unimportant court-martial\"\" is factually not true. It is very exceptional for the IDF to grant a political objector a full court martial where he can be defended by a lawyer and call witnesses (and make political speeches). It does not happen more often than once in a decade. The usual procedure is \"\"disciplinary proceedings\"\" where you are judged by a commaning officer in his bureau, with no lawyer or witnesses, and it lasts about five minutes - but the officer can only give a maximum of 28 days, unlike the full court martial which can give years. But the descision to have a full court martial is far from routine, it is taken on the highest levels. Then there is the fact that the act which the trial was about - a soldier writing \"\"subversive\"\" graffiti of 117 tanks and other military vehicles - is far from routine, it is certainly unique in Israel and I think quite exeptional for armies worldwide. And finally, Majorly jusitifed the decision to delete by stating \"\"The vast majority were delete comments, and there seemed to be consensus to delete\"\" . Now, I took a look at the deletion log of article submitted on January 8 together with mine . As far as I could see, virtually all of those which were fianlly deleted had a real ovewhelming majoroity in favor, many of them complete unanimity. The court martial artcile had nine in favor of deletion against five opposing deletion (if you don't count my own objection, with it there would be nine to six).  I saw that another article which was put up for deleteion in nearly the same time Arnie_Ginsburg, the result was  \"\"no concensus, default keep\"\".  []. I have a feeling this could have been the resut also with the Court Martial article. I don't know if I should try myself to put up all these arguments, it seems like a person trying to defend his own work is discounted.Adam Keller \"	10195

I would support however some sort of guidelines for arbs (and maybe admins) regarding what sort of complaints are clear reason for status change, and what are perhaps valid but less clearcut, and then, if the latter, some sort of discussion, maybe per RfC with a crat closing, regarding the conduct of the individual involved and how to deal with it. Personally, I think the \"\"us\"\" AGK used is potentially problematic, but could just be, potentially, a typo. Arbs are not necessarily required to write all comments like legal briefs, particularly if they themselves are not necessarily lawyers. Of course, if AGK, or any other arb in a potentially similar position, were to resign on their own, should that happen, that might be enough to address that specific situation, but no one should see my saying that as necessarily indicating I think such would necessarily be the way to proceed in this instance, because I don't think the matter necessarily rises to that level.

0	\"  ==Editor hrafn and the campaign to efface pages on sprituality and New Thought== I just found this page by taking a tour of pages that editor hrafn has recently started editing. Hrafn appears to be a single-purpose editor who removes material from pages that present biographies of, and books by, Christians and New Thought writers. Examples of inexperienced editors seeking help from a more exerienced editor when entire pages were found to be deleted (without prior discussion) or redirected (with loss of data) or merged (with loss of data) by hrafn are here,  here,  here,  here, and   here. See also the edit history of Wallace Wattles and Charles F. Haanel and their related discussion pages. Hrafn claims to merely be \"\"enforcing verifiability\"\" of biography pages, but the only pages he targets are those related to Christianity and New Thought. He summarily deletes material without discussion. He cuts biography lengths by 50% to 75% and then nominates the articles for deletion based on the \"\"non-notability\"\" of the bio subject. He has on one occasion deleted an entire page without discussion. It is very likely that, as evidence of his campaign of effacement and deletion is accumulated and follows him, he will either stop engaging in this practice or be proposed for blockage from editing spirituality and/or religion articles. If you know of other instances of his deletions and effacements, please list them. Thank you for your attention. catherine yronwode a.k.a. \"\"64\"\"   \"	10371

0	\"Hello, Rajan1986, and welcome to Wikipedia! Thank you for .  I noticed that one of the first articles you edited appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a conflict of interest. In other words, you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a neutral and objective way, because you are, work for, or represent, the subject of that article. Your recent contributions may have already been undone for this very reason.  To reduce the chances of your contributions being undone, you might like to draft your revised article before submission, and then ask me or any other editor to proofread it. See our help page on userspace drafts for more details. If the page you created has already been deleted from Wikipedia, but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft, don't hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page.  One rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately be blocked from editing. Wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have usernames which imply that the account belongs to a company or corporation. If you have a username like this, you should request a change of username or create a new account. (A name that identifies the user as an individual within a given organization may be OK.)  Here are some pages that you might find helpful: * The plain and simple conflict of interest guide * The five pillars of Wikipedia * Contributing to Wikipedia * Tutorial * How to edit a page and How to develop articles * How to create your first article (using the Article Wizard if you wish) * Simplified Manual of Style  I hope you enjoy editing here and being a Wikipedian!

0	\" :: Hi thanks for taking the time to respond Avi.  I had presumed you were Muslim because it said on your talkpage that you had contributed to the Abbey Hill Mosque article.  From your response I now gather you are of the Jewish faith so sorry if I have misrepresented you at any point. Have I got that right, you are Jewish, not Muslim? I also presumed you were from the UK (which is where I am from) because you had contributed to an article on a UK mosque.  Is that right? ::When I said most people are against it I meant that most people where I am from don't know much about it and if they did find out about the negative aspects of it (such as the complications (serious and minor), loss in sexual function, etc) then they would most likely take a somewhat negative view of it. I would apply this to all non-circumcising cultures.  These people may not campaign against it or join the genital integrity movement (if you could describe it as such), however they would in general have a negative view of it.  There are a few reasons as to why I think they'd view it somewhat negatively once you forced them to give their view on it.  ::It is done on children without their consent.  Most people would view this as ethically wrong - to not have any say in a major alteration to a part of your body (a particularly sensitive part at that).   ::It can cause pain (people generally don't like to see children in pain).   ::They then might ask if there was a reason for it to be done.  They would look at the views of the medical associations (via their policy statements on RIC) and find out that it isn't a net positive operation, therefore it doesn't need to be done for health reasons.  Furthermore, those that are not circumcised would realise it is a needless operation because they had done fine being intact. :: What I am saying is that most people do view it negatively (if they know about it and are forced to choose), they just don't bother saying anything because they do not wish to cause upset to a religious community or be accused of being intolerant.   :: I am not sure what bizarre forced circumcision you are referring to. :: Regarding the term/title of the article, I don't see how calling the article Male circumcision would equate it with female circumcision.  I realise they are different operations, but they still involve cutting of the genitals.  You also cannot deny that a lot of people refer to FGM (as you would call it) as female circumcision.  Furthermore, a lot of people, when asked to define \"\"circumcision\"\" would ask the question, \"\"which type?

Cf. the discussion on pages 184–186 in the book by Carl W. Ernst (\"\"While Muslims in other countries might find this objectionable, it seems to cause no comment in Iran.\"\"). It is a question of proportion. Safi takes the view, as an Iranian muslim, that images of Muhammad are okay. They're part of the culture he grew up in.

It is a reasonable summary to have the ferromagnetic core requirement in the lead.  The argument that not all ferromagnetic materials make good cores is irrelevant to the statement that all cores must be ferromagnetic.  This is the logical fallacy of denying the antecedent; all A are B is not invalidated because some B are not A.  That some new material for cores might be discovered that is not ferromagnetic is WP:CRYSTAL and also irrelevant, certainly not encyclopaedia worthy.

I don't hold any PhDs, nor do I feel I posses a \"\"body of knowledge\"\" that \"\"is very likely to dismiss...innocent guesses, or fractal knowledge.\"\"  I have, however, spent some time in Russia and in Kazakhstan, specifically Almaty. That is the name I always hear people use - Almaty. The Russians, however, still call it Alma-Ata. For example, I was living in Nizhny Novgorod for awhile, and no one there knew what I was talking about when I said Almaty. All the people I met in Almaty, however, say Almaty. When I see the name written on signs and billboards in the city, it is also written as \"\"Алматы\"\" (Almaty).   From my experience, only the Russians continue the use of Alma-Ata. As another example, the train station in Moscow says Алма-Ата (Alma-Ata). However, it also says Gorki instead of Nizhny Novgorod (most everyone there says Nizhny Novgorod, or \"\"Nizhny\"\" for short - I can't recall actually hearing \"\"Gorki\"\" used beyond the train station).  Also, It's not just the Kazakh government who uses that name - it's a lot of people. Many books about the region published nowadays also use Almaty (they sometimes mention \"\"the Soviet Alma-Ata\"\", much like Bishkek is the \"\"Soviet Frunze\"\".   As for using the scientific/scholarly-approved approach for naming, Wikipedia doesn't do that (as mentioned above). See, the \"\"scientific\"\" or \"\"academic\"\" method for writing the offical name of the country - Қазақстан - is actually Qazaqstan (the letter Қ being offically transliterated as Q in English). There area few academic books do that (look at works from Indiana University, for example), but outside of these small circles, people by and large write Kazakhstan with a \"\"K\"\"  - including Wikipedia. If people say we should use \"\"Alma-Ata\"\" because it's the correct name as dictated by academics, why no Qazaqstan?    Anyway, my point is that I found it surprising there are two different articles (Almaty and Alma-Ata). I think there should only be one, since regardless of the name it is still the same place. All the pictures and information should be seen together, on one page. They should be merged.   Oh, one more thing. I just went to Google and looked up \"\"Алматы\"\" (Almaty) - 4,270,000 hits. I then looked up \"\"Алма–Ата\"\" (Alma-Ata) - only 1,160,000.\"	10626

0	\"For the record, Larson was working on a Battlestar Pegasus movie for about 8-9 months when it became apparent that Universal wasn't going to go anywhere with the Galactica franchise. It turned out that Larson did have the rights through some contractual snafu on Universal's part to do anything with Commander Cain and the Pegasus, and his planned film involved the search for an ancient battlestar called the Atlantis, which was built by the 13th Tribe and deliberately left in a secret location with the maps to Earth. The film would have dealt with the search, a major battle with the Cylons, and the recovery and use of the maps to reach Earth, all w/o involving the Galactica or the RTF other than being mentioned.  The first article Google shows is this one: . And the Wikipedia set up for BSG had this one: [], although I'm not sure about whether there's some Wikirule about referencing other mini-Wikis. The John Larocque article on the attempt is at: []. Hollywood North Report has a short blurb about the Larson effort, but seeing as how their site has a *LOT* of popups from spammers attempting to load trojans and spyware, I'll quote it here to save your systems: \"\"In the spring of 1999, it was announced that Glen Larson was making plans to bring Galactica to the silver screen.  Impressed with the visual effects and style of the independently financed film Wing Commander, Larson paired with its producer, Todd Moyer, on an estimated $40-50 million film that was to shoot later that year in Luxembourg.   The story picked up where the series left off, but followed the exploits of Commander Cain and the battlestar Pegasus (made famous in the original series episode, \"\"The Living Legend,\"\" guest starring the late Lloyd Bridges).  In the concept, Commander Cain's search for the lost battlestar Galactica leads him to contemporary Earth, which, according to the story, was settled by humans who arrived here during prehistoric times on the very first battlestar, Atlantis.  Special effects were to be handled by Moyer's company, No Prisoners 3DFX, utilizing several of the artists who worked on Wing Commander.  Moyer planned to update some of Galactica's ships, including giving the Vipers the ability to morph into mechanized walkers-à la The Transformers-when on planet surfaces.  Moreover, he and Larson planned to expand the Galactica franchise to include an Imax film, a theme ride, and a new line of merchandise.  Then, as quickly as it had been announced, the project vanished from the radar screen.  It has been suggested that Larson and Moyer ultimately found themselves at odds over significant creative issues.  It has also been suggested that the film rights to Battlestar Galactica were still in some dispute.  In either case, the project disappeared into the ethers.\"\"  IIRC, Cylon.org had a page on this at one time, but since they revised their site this one and its copies of the concept drawings they had have disappeared.    \"	10742

Second, the AP article notes there is \"\"remaining radioactive debris\"\" at Tuwaitha.  I'm not sure if you've been on the ground (I leave that possibility open) but unless you have a source to back up your point, the AP article reads like there is other material there that are radiological.  But if we are actually reasoning together you will see that is not my main point about why we should post the AP article.  The AP source reaffirms that Iraq did have WMD material; known or unknown it not the point.  You claim yellowcake is not WMD material but the Canadians bought it to make nuclear energy so your definition of WMD material seems personal.  The reader of this entry on WMD should know that Iraq had this material and if not, this section of the site is imbalanced.  That is my point.\"	10994

Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.  If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or \"\"db\"\" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

0	::Femur dimensions estimates, when it comes to extrapolating to phylogenetically and morphologically disparate organisms are inherently inferior to volumetric ones, of course, a volumetric estimate is only as good as the model used and Greg Paul's are inaccurate, this are his skeletals of Stan and Sue, compare them to the ortographic images of the scanned skeletons from Hutchinson et al. study available here and Scott Hartman's skeletals. You find considerable scaling mistakes and conscious choices at articulated the bones that betray Paul's biases to making them as skinny as possible, like the scapular blade being too high in the torso or the concave gastralia that Hutchinson et al. already mentioned as inaccurate in their comments. Using a more accurate reconstruction and following a similar method to Greg Paul, Scott Hartman has estimated the mass of Sue at 8.4 metric tonnes. Now, for the article, since there's no paper that explicitly calls out the 6 tonne estimates as improbably light for the largest individuals I don't feel like we can outright replace it, maybe put up a range?   	11037

0	\"  == HighKing == Re. this and this. To put it bluntly, you don't know what you're talking about Murry. First, the IP is not me logging out to edit. HighKing has more than one person who objects to his edits, and rightly so. And second, HighKing was specifically warned by Cailil not to use his own interpretation of sources in making policing edits like this, which is exactly what he did by altering a direct quote that no longer existed on a page to read something else based on what he read in the banner, which has nothing to do with the quote. That is not policy compliant either in letter or spirit. His only policy based options were to remove it, or change the citation to point to where he subsequently found it. He did neither. His alteration of the quote was wrong, and his editting of the page to reflect the current contents of the cite, while not wrong in of itself, falls squarely under Cailil's other warnings. As an aside, in claiming the original author is the person who breached MOSQUOTE, you seem to be assuming that the error in locating the cite for the quote was down to the original author. I see no reason why that should be. It's far more likely that it was moved after the original author used that page as the cite for it. At the end of the day Murry, you're not doing HighKing any favours by defending him in this manner, and in doing so, you might even find yourself under scrutiny from Cailil for engaging in the same behaviour. I suggest you read the entire extended discussion under \"\"Removals of the term British Isles (again) on HighKing's talk page very carefully, lest you find yourself making the same errors in judgement he is making.   \"	11052

0	Any line segment can be divided continuously ad infinitum. At all times, with each division, the length of each part shortens by a half, while at the same time, the number of parts multiplies by two. So, how can an infinite number of parts, no matter how small they are, make up a finite whole? Because for every, not just some but all, division, the lengths of the parts are reducing as fast as the number of parts are increasing.  This means that even as the number of divisions tends to infinity, the corresponding halving of each part keeps the original line segment's length intact.	11074

0	\"   Hello James Cantor,  Thank you so much for your comments. The last 21 Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine have had wiki pages for a number of years and the wiki community has added as much information as is fitting a Nobel Laureate. I just find is unusual that Crusio's page is so much larger than those who are far more notable. I think Crusio's page size should be about the size of an average Nobel Laureate. I can not but wonder how Wim Crusio's page is so much bigger than that last 21 of the most recent Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine. As a scientist, one tends to plot data on a graph, and if you where to do so, Crusio's data point would be considered an out lier. As I stated, the wiki community has added as much information as is fitting a Nobel Laureate over many years. These pages have been edited by hundreds of users for many years, I think that gives us good yard stick, and says something about how much information a scientists site should have. While I agree with you that more \"\"good material\"\" is better, it appears that hundreds of wiki users disagree with this statement, based upon the data.\"	11321

The same is true of images in many other Wikipedia articles (including this one).

I'm not aware that it's even possible to do an image search in Google Books.  Anyway, here are a couple more refs for you to munch on: .

I understand that it wouldn't be able to determine if an image should become featured, but it could do the rest.  What I was thinking was this: *For old nominations, we can manually determine if it should be promoted, and place the phrase \"\"PROMOTED FILENAME.JPG\"\" or \"\"NOT PROMOTED\"\" on a new line in that subpage, and move the link to the subpage to the bottom of the current archive (link to that archive is determined by: [[Wikipedia:Featured pictures candidates/{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}}-{{CURRENTYEAR}}]] *Your bot could then determine if it was promoted or not, and do the following: *#If the image in that subpage has {{FPC}} or {{fpc}} in its summary, remove that tag and replace with {{FeaturedPicture}}, else just add the {{FeaturedPicture}} tag. Any other images displayed on the subpage should have their {{FPC}} or {{fpc}} removed if present. *#Add the following new line to Wikipedia:Goings-on, below the line which reads '''[[Wikipedia:Featured pictures|Pictures]] that gained \"\"featured\"\" status''' *#:*[[:Image:FILENAME.JPG|NAME_OF_SUBPAGE]] ({{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}) *#::(where NAME_OF_SUBPAGE is the name of the subpage where the FPC took place, without the prefixed text: Wikipedia:Featured picture candidates/ *#Add the following new line to Wikipedia:Featured pictures thumbs, below the first occurrence of > on the page: *#: *#Determine the person who nominated the image by either grabbing their first sig on the subpage, or (probably better) grabbing the first edit of that subpage *#Determine the person who uploaded the image (probably should use the most recent upload of the file; the one at the top). *#Add the following new lines to the bottoms of these two individual's talk pages: *#:==FPC== *#:{{PromotedFPC|FILENAME.JPG}} *#If the subpage says \"\"NOT PROMOTED\"\", remove the {{FPC}} or {{fpc}} from any of the images displayed on that subpage (people might on occasion link to an image, so be careful; [[:Image versus [[Image ).  This would cut our workload by a large amount, and all we would have to do is make sure we put \"\"PROMOTED FILENAME.JPG\"\" or \"\"NOT PROMOTED\"\" at the end of the subpage, and list the promoted pic on Wikipedia:Featured pictures visible and Wikipedia:Featured pictures.

The Quick Count (\"\"Conteo Rapido\"\", as opposed to the PREP, \"\"Programa the Resultados Electorales Preliminares\"\"), was a statistical sampling model of several polling places. It was meant as a statistical tool of prediction. The results from the Quick Count, which were made public some days later, showed that the statistical tests showed Calderon as winning in all three, but in two of them the difference was within the margin of error and in the third it was only barely outside. It was because of this, as per prior agreement, that the IFE declared the race too close to call (the prior agreement was that the IFE would either state which candidate was projected to be the winner based on the Conteo Rapido, or ask for a couple more hours to collate more results, or declare the race too close to call). The Quick Count was not the PREP. As it happens, the final tally agreed with the Quick Count results.  The PREP on the other hand is the quick dissemination of full results as reported by the district electoral councils to the IFE. There is no statistical component to the PREP, as opposed to the Quick Count which is an entirely statistical analysis of results.  See for example , in which Ugalde speaks of making the results from the Quick Count known, and whether the tecnical committee felt it would be possible to determine the electoral tendencies at the time.

Different people have different tastes, but Hellmuth's television appeal can be statistically proven.  Perhaps \"\"popular television\"\" would be more accurate, but the phrase \"\"great television\"\" is understood to mean just that.  \"\"Ice cream tastes great\"\" is not analagous because the verb 'tastes' serves as a link between the noun 'ice cream' and the adjective 'great' implying that ice cream is objectively great.

0	It is not a question of what the party's official or unofficial name is. It is a question of the correct way of titling encyclopaedia articles. If we put a definite article in one article, logically we have to put it in hundreds and hundreds of other articles (The Republican Party, The Australian Labor Party, The Church of England), which serves no good purpose and makes it harder for readers to find articles with the search device (try it and see). It should be a rule that article titles do not include the definite article, unless it is part of the title of a cultural product such as a newspaper (The Scotsman) or a book (The Grapes of Wrath).  	11662

It would have been up to one of the manufacturers to get them added to BS 5042 (the then standard for BC lampholders, now replaced by BS EN 61184), but presumably no manufacturer thought the cost of the effort worth what they would make in sales. BC plugs can still be found in some other countries which use BC lampholders. Occasionally they can be found for sale in the UK, but strictly it's illegal to sell them now. 	11790

0	==Public school controversies== In France and Belgium, there was a notable controversy at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century on the role of Masons in the establisment of a public school system. The idea was that since Masons were said to have played an important part in the founding of the Republic, the education system should allow a good deal of space for Masonic public educators. The educators were known as the Black Knights (Hussards noirs) because  their particular attire and devotion to secularist values. Conversely, all Catholic involvement in the education system was restricted or forbidden because of its seemingly religious character. This issue was for a long time at the forefront of difficult Church-State relations on the continent, and better access to private education was only granted in the 1980s after a long period of domination by the public sector. There were also similar issues in Mexico after the signing of the 1917 constitution.   	12007

In the article on mead, it says that mead is traditionally made with beer yeast and has an ABV of between 8% and 18%.

This is a very important difference between wine and beer, otherwise you'd just call barley wine barley ale or beer. The second point is that \"\" Honey Wine \"\" is generally not made with fruit of any kind.  If you used grapes it would be a pyment, and if you used fruit it would be a malomel.

Just wanted to point out to you the constant VANDALISM that is done by the user and a croatian nationalist-Ivan Stambuk on many of the article pages regarding South SLavic languages, Srbocroatian language, etc. Besides vandalising some of the discussion pages, where he and his mate-'Ceha', having NO ARGUMENTS to argue, - constantly erase some well known facts about those topics, they often argue using an offensive voice to everyone who doesn't agree with them on wikipedia. It seems like Ivan Stambuk and 'Ceha' are 2 lonely fighters for some irrational nationalistic lies about the South Slavic languages, constantly fighting with the rest of the world, ha, ha. He (Ivan Stambuk) is also creating some ridiculous and partial maps showing only a half of the Shtokavian speaking area (the other half is spread through Serbia and Montenegro) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shtokavian_dialect , or trying to camouflage the factual state of the close ties within the Central South Slavic system (language) at the templates featured in the articles about any of the South Slavic languages and dialects. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbo-Croatian_language  Recently he (Ivan Stambuk), or some of his few supporters (very possibly -Ante Perkovic, also a cro-nationalist, with no tie to reality:)) ) erased a recent post from a friend of mine, a Croat who wrote some factual things about SerboCroatian language that Ivan Stambuk and Ante Perkovic are unsuccessfully trying to hide or minimize, on the discussion page of the article of SerboCroatian Language. That malicious and pathetic behavior by these 2-3 users openly sends a message of hatred and separatism, and it is non-acceptable on wikipedia pages.  Although they (Ivan Stambuk and Ante Perkovic) have been BANNED many times, ha, ha (We remember You've banned Ivan Stambuk last time 2 weeks ago:)) ) it seems like they've not learned their lesson well. Please, if you can, do something to stop this VANDALISM by Ivan Stambuk and Ante Perkovic on the above mentionned wikipedia articles and discussion pages, and if necessary, please BAN them for a longer time, so they won't damage wikipedia with their lies and misinformations.

0	\"   ==Response to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann==  I reverted your edit because you give partial information, not because of the  wording I prefer. What parts do not make sense? The ones you deleted that says there is a joint working group? Stop saying it is bad English, if it was just that you'd fix it without removing information.  \"\"Garcia added that when the PJ is criticized then the British police are also criticized because of their close cooperation\"\" What you wrote does not make sense and it is a bad summary of the Portuguese article:  *1-  It is not just close cooperation, it was created a joint working group right from the start with the British police. This is why the British police are also criticized. Just close cooperation they have with the Interpol, the Europol and other police organizations. No working group was created with them. I hope it is clear.   *2- Several unfair critics were made to the  methodology used by the Portuguese police. Garcia defends that the number of abductions that results in murder is a decisive factor that determines the different investigation methodologies adopted by Portuguese and British police.  ::Other facts indirectly related to the different methodology:  *3-Personnel attacks were made to police officers because of the different methodology used referred to as \"\"forging evidence\"\": \"\"He [Gonçalo Amaral] was the victim of personal attacks by the British media which not only questioned his honour as a policeman, but also attacked him as a human being.\"\"   *4- Portugal has 9 unsolved cases of missing children under 18 (including Madeleine). In spite of all the resources available and the different methodology, the UK has 124 unsolved cases of missing children under 14, in the last four years.(National Missing Persons Bureau).   It seems that the British  methodology alone was not enough to solve these cases. Besides this:   *5-The UK has a serious problem with child trafficking     *6-A serious problem with African children that just go missing:   *5- No criticism was ever made to the lack of results of the investigation of the Control Risks Group, hired by the Mcanns since May. \"\"The investigation [of the PJ], we've stated all along, has the most likely chance of us finding her\"\" Something made them change their minds?  The use of a different methodology is not only used because there are very few cases where the abducted child dies, Portugal does not have the kind of serious problems with children's abduction and trafficking that the UK has.  I hope it was clearly written and the \"\"parts of it do not make sense\"\" start to make sense.

0	\"  == Dubious claims about clearly non-transgenderd people ==  This article lists a whole bunch of people whos transgender status is clearly wrong and others for whom it is highly speculative.  This isn't a list of people who \"\"kinda, sorta, there's a small chance, maybe\"\" are transgender.  The ones who cross-dressed for some nefarious/deceptive purpose and not as a life style choice clearly can not be classified as transgender and should be removed from the article completely.  The fact that mythological figures such as Achilles were even added in the first place says a lot about the POV pushing of the people who supported it.  The only mythological one who might be considered transgenderes is Guan Yin.  The real life figures who did it to disguise themselves to avoid something (e.g. military service) or even to get into something where women are discriminated against.  They did it for deceptive purposes as well, so they can't really be considered transgendered.  The pope one is laughable and definitely should be removed.  The one about Joan of Arc is based exclusively on an accustion from a unreliable source.  If they accused her of being a witch, should we have included her in a list of witches too?  Also, I'd like to see an authoritative source showing that she was even accused of it as it seems that it's most Wikipedia ripped sites and LGBT websites that site that as fact.  And what are \"\"transvestite tendencies\"\" in reference to Ed Wood?  You need to start citing sources or I'm just going to start deleting them.  That goes mainly for the historical and mythological figurse section.  Maxwell Klinger wasn't even a real transvestite, he only did that so he'd get a section 8 and get kicked out of the army.  Anyone who watched the show knows he would try all kinds of crazy stuff to get kicked out under the guise of being mentally ill.  This phrase describing the character is also very odd: \"\"Although a transvestite, he loudly denied any charges of homosexuality.\"\"  What's the association between the two?  Also, it appears they're using a warped definition of transgender here.  I've never heard a definition that would automatically include cross-dressers as if that automatically means they identify with the opposite gender rather than just enjoying the clothes.  I'm sorry, but this overly broad and incorrect definition of transgender is obviously an attempt just to make the list as long as possible.   28 June 2005 21:00 (UTC)\"	12312

0	==The Signature of the Atomic Bomb= There are good reasons to claim that the catastrophical event of the atomic bombing of Japan, marks the shift to what we here term contemporary in regard of art as defined in the contents page per 27 October 2010, or 19 Dhu al-Qidah 1431, or 19 Heshavan 5771. Butoh may thus be regarded as the epitome of contemporary art. Except from this, it is a problematic definition for a number of reasons. First. Art by artists working both before the World War II, during and after, can not necessarily be defined as more, or less, contemporary because of this timestamp. Contemporary art did explicitly exist also before World War II, as this label - contemporary - has been expressed as a mark of quality, pertaining especially to modernism, by art carrying an ideal summoning, from the artist or his genius, making some kind of composed expression of what, in such case, are to be evaluated or considered the spirit of the time, reflecting or in dialogue with the contemporary world, in the event of the art-making process including its publication or presentation. Another trickster is, for me, that the concept of contemporaneousness also must be regarded in relation to art that specifically deals with contemporarity as it moved through time. It is absurd as a Norwegian to not consider Henrik Ibsen a maker of contemporary art. His plays are distinguished by being contemporary plays and historic plays. I sincerly believe that Henrik Ibsen was intending to make drama that also were to be transformed, or may I say be transported by the unfolding of time. The retrospective style of his contemporary plays is at least a strong indication for that his plays not necessarily should stay in the conformity of the 19th century. I think it is possible to find many other reasons for striking out such a definition of contemporary art as this lexicalisation implies.   	12341

This has been done under the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article seems to be blatant advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read the general criteria for speedy deletion, particularly item 11, as well as the guidelines on spam.   If you can indicate why the subject of this article is not blatant advertising, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please add  on the top of the article and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would help make it encyclopedic, as well as adding any citations from reliable sources to ensure that the article will be verifiable.

0	==Help requested to mediate deletion of article Maurizio Giuliano==  Dear Chair,  The above article has been the subject of changes and disputes, and finally it has been deleted.  I was involved in editing the article, and I honestly can disclose the fact that I know the subject of the article.  But I honestly don't feel that I am biased in favour of the article - though as a lawyer, I trust you can better see whether I am indeed objective as I claim to be.  To the best of my perception, most if not all the changes, and the deletion itself, saw the involvement of a specific user, whom I shall not mention out of courtesy.  I was surprised by the objections and changes made by the user, but did not object, and instead worked with him to solve the issue and improve my own objectivity.  We had some useful correspondence and I felt the issue was being addressed informally.  PROBLEM: Now however, the article has been deleted.  And I can see on the deletion discussion, that there was no consensus at all.  One specific user pushed for the deletion, and a decision was taken to delete, despite many votes to keep.  The discussion seems to me very biased against the subject of the article, and I note the following:  * The objector stated that his status as Guinness record holder is not proven.  The subject IS in the Guinness Book of World Records, 2006 edition, page 126 on the UK edition.  I can send a copy of the scanned page by email or upload it as may be requested.  I think this already makes him notable.  (The objector pointed out that some online media cited him as being 23 when he broke the record.  He was instead 28, and this is reflected correctly in the Guinness Book and in other media.  Some media just got it wrong.  I don't see why this should be relevant).  * Regarding his books, the subject published two books.  The objector claimed that these are self-published sources.  That is true.  But there is also plenty of third-party materials about his books, which you can find online.  So, he published two books which have been reviewed by others - he is an author.  I think this is enough for inclusion.  * Finally, the strangest thing: the objector disputes his notability as a UN official !  The issue here is that his status as a UN official was not even mentioned in the article - certainly not until I last saw it !  So, why did this become a topic for discussion ?  This makes me almost suspect that there may be a 'personal' element.  * Regarding other articles where he is cited...  The same user has also deleted his name - among many - from the article on the Centre for Social Studies, where there was a sentence stating that the Centre's published authors included him.  How can this be disputed ?  There is a book with ISBN etc. available on Amazon, clearly indicating that he is the author and the Centre is the publisher.  This should be sufficient proof of the fact that he is one of the Centre's published authors.  I hope you can resolve the dispute, and my ideal solution would be: - The article is reinstated, and you can make any changes to it you deem appropriate. - If there is anything substantial I object to or if I want to add new info, I shall contact you (or someone you might designate) instead of making changes directly. - The one user who keeps objecting to the article should be asked to refrain from making changes directly, and instead go via you (or someone you might designate).  Thanks in advance.  	12454

Will he go after the WWE Championship – currently held by Randy Orton – and look to regain the title he never lost in the ring from a man who never beat him for it? Or will Cena look to conquer a different mountain and challenge an old foe, World Heavyweight Champion Edge, or a new kingpin, ECW Champion Chavo Guerrero, for a title he has never worn?\"\" *Kane's reign \"\"Then there’s the state of the ECW Championship held by Kane, who was also drafted over to Raw on Monday. Although ECW gained the services of United States Champion Matt Hardy, the Land of the Extreme is now left with no World Champion of their own, and only a one-in-three chance to win it back at Night of Champions... On Sunday, the Big Red Machine will defend the title in a Triple Threat Match against Big Show and Mark Henry. While the World's Largest Athlete remains on SmackDown, the World's Strongest Man was pulled to ECW in Wednesday's Supplemental Draft, and is that brand's chance to bring the title back to the Land of the Extreme. But, if Triple H, Edge and Big Show have an extremely good Night of Champions, SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero could conceivably find her brand the home of all three World Championships, with both Raw and ECW left out in the cold.\"\" *Morrison's reign (Fast Forward to 3:30) \"\"These accolades are only fitting of a true champion, and I have an accolade that very few people in sports entertainment can claim. I am a World Champion. I am the new face of ECW. I am the ECW World Heavyweight Champion.\"\" *Henry's reign (Fast Forward to 0:25) 'There is a lot of talent in the ECW locker room, but I am a twelve-year veteran. This is my first World Heavyweight Title and I'll tell you one thing, it's going take a more powerful man than I am to take this title out of my hands.\"\" *Hardy's reign \"\"The greatest achievement, however, came in 2008 when Matt triumphed in a Championship Scramble Match to capture the ECW Title; his first taste of World Championship gold.\"\" *Hardy's reign continued \"\"After the contest was unscrambled and the winner was clear, Matt Hardy stood victorious as the new ECW Champion in the opening Scramble Match at Unforgiven... After a passion-driven, career-long hunt to possess a World Title, the deliverer of the Twist of Fate has found himself atop the mountain in the Land of the Extreme.\"\" *Christian's reign \"\"Christian’s first World Title comes after a journey that expands well beyond his two months in the Land of the Extreme. \"\" *Christian's reign continued (Fast Forward to 0:55) \"\"This is the first of three World's Championship matches here at SummerSlam as Captain Charisma electrifies the Staples Center here at SummerSlam.\"\" *Christian's reign continued (Fast Forward to 2:15) \"\"Josh, to illustrate the global impact of this contest, if William Regal wins the ECW Championship he'll become the ninth non-US born superstar to capture a World Title' in the last 15 years. The WWE has certainly gone global and who better to wear the crown than William Regal\"\" :Once again, WWE recognized the ECW title to be a world heavyweight championship throughout its existence until the discontinuation of the brand, which resulted in all references pertaining to ECW being removed from WWE programming soon thereafter.

Please review WP:V to learn about appropriate, reliable sources for the information you keep adding, and also visit WP:LIBEL and WP:BLP to learn about appropriate information in biographical articles of living people. Insinuating that these two individuals are having an affair or are anything other than faithful to their respective significant others is libelous, and against Wikipedia policy. You have not provided a reliable source to support the POV suggested by your edits. WP:NPOV will help you learn about Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy.  The quotes you have added are taken out of contexttheir mentions of a \"\"crush\"\" on each other were done in a joking manner, and another cast member followed their comments by saying she had a crush on both of thembut that's not grounds for speculating that the cast member in question is having an affair with both of them, and if I said or insinuated that she were, that would be libel. These quotes are cast members speaking highly of each other, and frankly, good public relations by supporting their on-screen chemistry and by extension, that of the fictional characters they play. Many other cast members have complimented their co-stars, including PD and EP, but no reliable source has, to my knowledge, ever published information that these two (or any other cast members) were anything other than co-stars who happen to be friends. On the contrary, both speak frequently of their significant others in high esteem (in print and on camera), and speak well of each other's partners. There's also a question of whether such compliments are even relevant in the grand scheme of the article, but that's a moot point because your edits are unsourced, and against the WP:LIBEL policy.  If you have a reliable source for your edits, in accord with WP:Verifiability, then it's a different story, but as it is, your edits are potentially libelous and not in accord with Wikipedia editing policy.  \"	12903

0	Are you people honestly going to consider Fightmetric as realiable when you don't have their official medical records immeadiatly after the fight (the upper lip laceration on Lyoto caused not mental damage and wasn't even operated on till days after the fight). The left wrist injury is stated to exist on Lyoto as a previous condition. We could go on about how Lyoto hit the better targets and with better technique in terms of penetration (see Rua's black eye, etc...) but I am saying that using Fightmetric is unreliable. It is supposed to be guys who have PHDs in statistics judging a fight based on what they though was power. You have no monitoring of consciousness, heart rate, x-rays,etc...all you have is heresay and a biased opinion. Fightmetric is not used on Lyoto's page either because it is biased. It even records Rua's leg kicks to Lyoto's legs as more powerful than Lyoto's round kicks to the body; a clear biased view of Maui Thai compared to Shotokan Karate especially since Lyoto's legs are traveling a slightly further distance and hitting a more vulnerable area (ribs, kidneas, liver, intestines, you be the judge). Enough with the biased views, FightMetric is not valid and I say that any who relie on its pseudoscience is a one-sided fool. If they where hooked up with equipment that didn't hinder there abilitys to record the Force i.e. F=MA or Force= MasX Acceleration and if they could at least clock the speed of the kicks and the mass of Rua's legs as compared to Lyotos I might back Fightmetric, but until then it is not good evidence of anything but a for profit site.	13001

Prospective students can always call up their own state board, or the school's offices and ask questions.

0	\"== Forbes Magazine's \"\"Most Powerful\"\" Ranking ==  There is an increasing number of Forbes Magazine references appearing in the leading paragraphs of biographical wiki pages.  The opening paragraphs of a wiki page should contain important details, not subjective trivia.  Forbes 'most powerful' ranking is merely one American magazine editor's perceived and unsupported opinion as to each well-known person's 'power'.  By rights it should not appear on any wiki page other than the Forbes magazine page or Forbes Magazine ranking page. It appears the less powerful an important person or celebrity is, the more likely (s)he is to have a Forbes ranking on their wiki page.  Truly powerful people do not.  For example: Barack Obama (President, USA) - No mention of Forbes ridiculous ranking on his page Vladimir Putin (Prime Minister, Russia) - No mention of Forbes Dmitry Medvedev (President, Russia) - No mention of Forbes David Cameron (Prime Minister, United Kingdom) - No mention of Forbes Benjamin Netanyahu (Prime Minister, Israel) - No mention of Forbes Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (King, Saudi Arabia) - No mention of Forbes Nicolas Sarkozy (President, France) - No mention of Forbes Ali Khamenei (Supreme Leader, Iran) - No mention of Forbes Naoto Kan (Prime Minister, Japan) - No mention of Forbes Ashfaq Parvez Kayani (Chief of Army Staff, Pakistan) - No mention of Forbes So why do the Forbes rankings keep appearing all over wiki?  Is there a wiki rule to stop the magazine from obtaining free advertising at wiki's expense?    :Sorry but what does this have to do with the main page? (Also while I have no opinion on whether Forbes ratings belong it hardly seems surprising that the less 'powerful' and important person or celebrity is, the more likely they are to have a Forbes rating. You don't need a Forbes rating to tell you Barack Obama is important. You just need to words, 'President of the United States'. The same with all the rest you mentioned.)     ::Why do Forbes Magazine's unsubstantiated rankings garner support on wiki?  They are obviously fabricated.  Many are rubbish.  For example, Forbes rank Michelle Obama as the most powerful woman in the world.  Yet it is Barack who is the president, not Michelle.  As 'First Lady' Michelle has no power whatsoever. ::How about the number 2 'ranked' woman?  It is an American food saleswoman (Irene Rosenfeld).  What complete baloney.  Number 3 is an American television host (Oprah Winfrey), and finally at number 4 is a woman with real power, the Chancellor of Germany (Angela Merkel).  Forbes incredibly has ranked an American grocer and an American television host above a head of government. ::My question is, why does a supposedly factual encyclopaedia (wiki) rate worthy of mention the suppositions and meanderings of a magazine that specialises in listening to gossip rather than in researching facts? ::    :::So what does this have to do with the main page? :::If you don't think the information belongs in articles the place to discuss that is on the talk page of the effected articles.

This page and its subpages contain their ideas; it is hoped that this project will help to focus the efforts of other Wikipedians.  If you would like to help, please inquire on the talk page and see the to-do list there.

For more information on WikiProjects, please see Wikipedia:WikiProjects and Wikipedia:WikiProject best practices.  This project has been created in an attempt to improve existing articles relating to Ireland, and to help with the creation of needed articles. It aims primarily to provide information in consistent format for articles on places in, or related to Ireland.  On top of this, it aims to get the main Ireland article to featured status, whilst aiding the maintenance and improvement of the Ireland Portal.  * Northern Ieland has a population of approximately 1.7 million.  * One of the greatest aids in this project for assessment and improving of articles, are the  logs found here Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Ireland articles by quality/1 and here Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Ireland articles by quality/2. Please take a look at the entries there as it will guide you on which articles need assessed, and will also guide you as to what might be necessary to improve individual articles.  Articles and categories relating to Ireland are extensive and work needs to be/is being done across a multitude of areas.  In order to gain the benefits of collaboration, please update this page with any relevant \"\"to do\"\"s.  ==Recent developments==  * Belfast has been successful as the Wikipedia:WikiProject UK geography's collaboration of the month.

If you don't join WikiProject Community, I will hunt you down and make your life a Living Hell. •    :Oh crap! did I type that? I think I had a bit too much rum! My apologies. What I want to say is that I've had, since I been at wikipedia this notion of a \"\"sense of community\"\". I thought a community writing about \"\"community\"\" would be a popular idea, and catch on, but if you look at the project page history and even the talk page, you'll see that I'm the only one there. Look at WikiProjects like Wikipedia:WikiProject Michigan it's like a beehive! Wikipedia:WikiProject The Beatles is probably the most innovative and productive organized group at Wikipedia. It's silly that the \"\"community builders task force\"\" is really just one guy. I feel like deleting the whole thing, sometimes.  was interested and encouraging for a while, when we first started it, but he's doing wikimania and many other things.   :Anyway, the community article is coming along very well now. I've created a list of sources at the bottom of the list of community topics and I'm listing more as I find them.    [the following is copied from CQ's talk page]  Ah, rum.  Here I thought wow, somebody finally recognizes my unique brilliance!  Oh well...  I don't think that two makes a community either, but I've been meaning to sign up. I've been involved with communities of various kinds for many years. Community is an ephemeral thing, really. It is the oxygen we breathe and most of us don't stop to think about it. I guess that's why there isn't a stampede.  It is like the way that people avoid talking about process. But let's see, Michigan = community of place.  The Beatles = community of interest.  Hummm.... something topical.  Well there is interest in intentional communities of all kinds... and, of course, ecovillages. So maybe that is an angle to begin with... Anyway, I'm in.     :Now you're talkin' Sunray! ) Two heads are better than one. I think once  and the others see progress on Community articles by quality, they may rejoin the effort. I'm heading over to Virtual community to start shaking things up over there. It's an attractive topic and the article is nearly as big a mess as community was. Hopefully I can recruit a few members from over there.   :Now that the tools are in place, we can approach the list as a series based upon importance and public interest. Feel free to drop the {{WikiProject Community}} tag on as many articles as you like. Do you know of a tool that tracks \"\"hit counts\"\" for wikipedia articles? I suppose talk page activity is a pretty good indicator. It would be nice to have a tool that can quantify that.  :Talk:Virtual community has a {{onlinesource}} tag on it, so I think it's a good next focus. I'm threatening to bump that article down to 'stub-class' and stick a {{rewrite}} tag on it. Maybe that will furrow a few brows. I'm also thinking of bumping Community up to A-class but i would like to find another article that can get quickly to B-class. (Take a look at Vital articles) Any ideas? •    :P.S. I meant the brilliance comment )  ::The brilliance comment certainly got my attention.  Seems to me that the next step is knowing what the individual's unique brilliance is, hence you begin to get at motivation. Positive feedback would then reinforce that motivation.

The references are in the inlay booklets provided with CD's so don't delete it. Also it clearly states her hit singles career was very much gone by the 1980's after several changes in musical styles, many of which finished off bands that were in when Suzi Quatro was at her peak. It was new wave that finally finished Suzi's recording career, that and motherhood. Also what is this rubbish about her being a major rock star? I could perhaps agree she was in the 1970's but certainly not now! Infact most young people below about 25 have probably never even heard of her. She had her last U.K top 75 hit in 1982 and her last hit in America in 1981 for crying out loud!

0	I would agree with 115.189.224.101 that an inoperative ILS could hardly have contributed to the accident. Although the pilot was relatively inexperienced on the 777, he has close to 10,000 flying hours according to one of the reports i have read. I just refuse to believe that a pilot with that level of flying experience cant land on a runway in clear, broad daylight without automated assistance. The crash in my opinion is similar to the crash of Turkish Airlines flight 1951 where although the aircraft was a B 737 - 800, none of the 3 pilots who were in the cockpit noticed the drop in airspeed until it was too late for recovery.

0	\"::: Simple solution. Rename the article to \"\"Dhimmi, according to Bat Ye'or and Bernard Lewis\"\". The article is overburdened with the views of a handful of orientalists. In addition to that, as Tony points out, the article is effectively a series of polemic statements deriding the historic practices that occured under the Dhimmi system. If this article isn't a commentary (and POV-driven indictment) on history, then there's the burden to prove that Shariah as practiced today also supports the kinds of restrictions on dhimma that the article claims it to. Sections discussing history should make it clear that their content is historical, and should not contrast events and policies practiced in the 8th or 10th century with standards we accept today. Sections dealing with contemporary usage of dhimma in countries that run under Shariah should make it clear what aspects of the dhimmi system are still being practiced.    \"	13526

0	\"  == The Band's legacy, Beggar's Banquet, etc. ==  An anonymous user is repeatedly misreading The Guardian source and insisting on adding a dubious tag to it.  Here's the direct quote:  :The spark for Fairport taking this watershed turn was the Band's 1968 album Music from Big Pink, the record that - along with Bob Dylan and the Band's Basement Tapes bootleg - brought about a widespread musical volte-face, in which what remained of psychedelia was replaced by a new rootsiness. Among the rock aristocracy, its influence was evident in the Beatles' ill-fated back-to-basics project Let It Be, the Rolling Stones' purple patch that began with Beggars Banquet, and Eric Clapton's decision to call time on Cream.  The anonymous user takes issue with this statement, claiming that Music from Big Pink could not have influenced Beggar's Banquet because of chronology, i.e., that the Stones were almost done recording the album when Big Pink came out.  But, read the statement: it does not say that it influenced the recording of Banquet, but the \"\"purple patch that began with...,\"\" etc.  This seems clear to me.

Repeating a false claim thousands of times does not make it correct, but Debian just uses copies of their false claims to \"\"proove\"\" their claims. So what remains? The only provable facts are that Debian started to attack cdrtools in spring 2004 and that Debian at the same time stopped distributing the original cdrtools in favor of their own defective fork from spring 2004 that was later reamed (on my instructions) in autumn 2006.

I chose pistols, and we will fight at a distance of 15 cm.  The fight will tak place in three weeks time 205m off the east coast of Newfoundland.  Acceptable?  30 June 2005 14:02 (UTC) Response from coward ends. *dongs As you are ignorant of even the most rudimentary conventions of honorable duelling it is my duty to inform you that it is the challenger, not the challenged who determines distance, as stated in rule #16 of the Codo Duello. You must also elaborate on the pistols to be used, otherwise I will assume any caliber semi-automatic is permissable. As you have chosen the grounds, you are also responsible for providing the boat on which the pistol duel will take place. If you are unable to find a boat with a large enough deck to accomodate an honorable duel (at least twenty paces of unobstructed space in a corridor ten feet wide) another option is that two smaller boats may be used, in calm seas. Inflatable rafts and non-motorized dingheys are not acceptable. I must commend you on selecting a cowardly weapon which greatly complicates the relatively straightforward process of an at-seas duel, you perfidious poltroon. Should you miraculously acquire vertabrae between now and the chosen date, I will gladly agree to a change in weapons, especially to epees. The time is acceptable to me. Please note that duels cannot take place within the jurisdiction of Canada, and therefore must take place at least 200 nautical miles (not standard miles) from the continental margin, to avoid breaking laws which expressly forbid dueling.   I await the duel eagerly. Please offer my advance condolences to your family members.  \ \EDIT: EPEE, MORE LIKE E-PEEN AM I RITE GENTLEMENS	13699

1	HI JohnHistory  Yes, you will be blocked and your thoughtful post here deleted by someone like Tarc.  The main thing to realize is that Wikipedia has always been, and will always be, a clusterfuck.  If you're interested in finding out detailed histories of the lives of anime characters, it's a start, but other than that, it's virtual pages are only good for wiping virtual shit out of your virtual asshole.  This place attracts the worst kind of assholes, and it's hard to trust in the good faith of something from which nothing but shit and hot air spews forth.  They decide what a proper source is, they decide what's been discussed in the media, just like they decide which place in SF has the best glory holes.  Any type of internet arrangement with a hierarchy attracts the worst type of vaginal discharge.  Wikipedia's political content is governed by a bunch of aborted leftists who read a couple of pages of Das Kapital, decided it was nice and then put it down.  They are a bunch of fucking cocksuckers, literally and figuratively.	13829

There's positive evidence that I am not the same person as these two, so I see no reason why I should pretend to have the burden of proof in this matter.  Based on this, I feel sufficient cause for the removal of all claims of sock-puppetry.

0	\"  Agreed.  We really should try to stick to the subject of the article at hand.  And looking through the Jeremy Clarkson article I see there really isn't a lot about his penchant for speed. It's mentioned, but just briefly, alongside his clean driving  record. However in searching via Google, I found this article,  http://driving.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,12529-1890873_2,00.html  This to me seems rather striking, to have somebody talking so openly about speed.  Maybe we could change the article around to be,  In spite of his penchant for speed, Clarkson holds a clean driving licence. None the less, he is not especially reluctant to discuss the subject of speed. In a November 2005 article in \"\"The Sunday Times\"\", Mr. Clarkson wrote, while discussing the Bugatti Veyron, \"\"On a recent drive across Europe I desperately wanted to reach the top speed but I ran out of road when the needle hit 240mph\"\", and later, in the same article, \"\"From behind the wheel of a Veyron, France is the size of a small coconut. I cannot tell you how fast I crossed it the other day. Because you simply wouldn’t believe me\"\".  Could we write that ?  These two quotes are rather remarkable, in my opinion, and worth mentioning in the article.  They demonstrate his honest and frank manner of discussing his travels across Europe. And we could just leave it to the reader to decide if he is talking about going 240mph on public roads, or whatever. I realize you may feel differently about Mr. Clarkson than I do, but none the less, these two quotes do clarify his penchant for speed, and are worth mentioning, alongside his clean driving record, I would say.  \"	14066

I understand that the prostitutes you procure so regularly laugh at the size of your penis, however I would implore you not to let this shortcoming (if you'll pardon the pun) stamp out the fun that happy, prosperous and sexually capable teenagers can have vandalising wikipedia. Hopefully you wake up and learn that those of us who don't want to consume cannabis, live of welfare payments, drop out of university and edit \"\"incoherent ramblings\"\" on Wikipedia for a living may want to have a facet to their lives which does grant them fun without having to chase pink elephants around their parent's basements all day.   Also, Bongwarrior is two words - and therefore in my opinion your username constitutes an \"\"incoherent rambling\"\". But then again, your probably too high and sexually deprived to employ any reason and acknowledge this. You're parents having \"\"relations\"\" is probably one of the most costly mistakes that society will have to bear - because undoubtably everybody else's taxes will be use to subsidise the treatment you receive for schizophrenia in five years.

0	:::Look Kevin, Trouton was a very smart physicist and a fantastic experimentalist, if he for a second anticipated that his calculations would give a null result do you think that he would have devised and undertaken the experiment?

0	\"  Everybody: you're wrong. Everyone here except Bretonbanquet has said that they think that the numbering should continue on side two. This isn't about what anyone thinks; it's about reliable sources - in this case, the label of a vinyl record. It is also about reality - and as usual, people here are trying to make Wikipedia into an alternative universe rather than an encyclopedia. So, in a nutshell, it doesn't really matter what any of you think. If you can produce a copy of this or any album where the numbering on side two is continued from side one, rather than beginning again from track one, by all means, it should be noted in the article, because that would be an accurate representation of how the record was presented to the public, as well as a reliable source. Problem solved. By arbitrarily deciding on a numbering system that is contrary to what actually exists in the real world, you are using original research, which some people here tend to frown upon. As far as the problem of younger people not understanding the numbering: even today's young people are capable of working out the logic behind something with two different \"\"sides\"\" being numbered differently.   I also don't agree that the sides should be eliminated completely; an album article is supposed to reflect the reality of the initial release, which, for most of the best music ever recorded, is vinyl. It is our responsibility to convey that reality accurately, not to revise it.     \"	14179

Different authors have analyzed slightly different situations using different means.  :: I also think accelerated rods are quite relevant and related (again, I borrowed this from Hillman, though I added the wiki-link to Born rigid motion).  Note that we are currently arguing accelerated motion with Rod Ball.  I would say that the topic is therfore closely related, though not identical.  That's just what the intro says.  Strings and spaceships share much of the same physics as rods and spaceships, in the final analysis.

0	:That's a difficult question.  I think a lot of it is a matter of just doing it on a day-to-day basis in every discussion we have on WP, whether on an article talk page, a deletion discussion, or at VP.  Maybe there could be a guideline (or even just an essay) urging people not to rely on rote policy citation regurgitation in lieu of substantive explanation (maybe there already is one somewhere?).  And reminding people that citing policy is at best only half the work: you may have settled on what you think governs the issue, but you still need to convince others of the best way to apply it in a particular circumstance.  To do it properly the focus should always be on what the best editorial decision is, not just the superficial level of what complies with codified policy or guidelines.  Yeah, all that should be written down somewhere if it isn't already.  In another guideline for people to cite.  ; )  :I think also we could go policy by policy, guideline by guideline, and ask ourselves whether its purpose is clear.  What does it substantively accomplish.  That may not always be evident; it may reflect the way consensus tends to go without an articulate reason as to why.  A history of how the policy was written could be interesting, but maybe not that helpful, and it would be difficult to summarize.  Just looking at the edit history of a particular policy or guideline may omit a lot of developmental discussions that occurred on the talk pages of other policies, the Village pump, or even user talk pages.

He is agreeing that the series (0.9, 0.99, 0.999, ...) has a limit of 1, but he is not agreeing that the corresponding decimal 0.999... should be said to be equal to 1, but that they must instead differ by some as yet undefined infinitesimal amount.  :The reason that an infinite series in the real number system has a sum equal to the limit of its corresponding partial finite sums is that the real number system is defined in such a way that two numbers which differ by at most an \"\"infinitesimal\"\" quantity must be equal.  The article Archimedean property has a section that explains why the reals have no non-zero strictly positive infinitesimal numbers.

Nazi Germany was at war and used Baltic sea making it legal under the demilitarization treaty for the Finns move troops there (technically they could have kept troops there the whole time - its not Finnish problem if SU cant understand treaty texts).

0	\"I don't know anyone who has entertained the belief that Bacon had buggered Jonson. As for his servants, that may be a different matter. Bray suspects that it may have been the money Bacon gave them that brought the matter to notice: certainly, homosexual relations between masters and servants were clearly common enough to provoke the satirists. As for the weight allotted to it in the article: this is a classic situation in Wikipedia. Any implication of homosexuality in an historical figure has to be detailed and fully referenced beyond normal expectation, otherwise it is then accused of being an unsupported allegation, with the resulting endless edit war. In addition, the earlier point made on this thread about including it: \"\"Because a significant amount of modern scholarship is focused on how it affected the development of his ontology\"\" is extremely valid. The growth of gay studies departments within universities in recent years, and the flood of research and interpretation, is having a significant impact, and is literally re-writing history. To give a tiny example: the discoveries and interpretations in Crompton's 'Byron and Greek Love' have affected every Byron biography published after 1985.

0	\"  == TruSilver, Mediation, et al ==  :You can include the following statement as part of the mediation template if you wish: I'm not able to edit at the moment because jdchamp's admin shopping on WP:AIV finally paid off  While, obviously, I'm happy to accept any attempt to produce a better US Mobile Phone Companies template, I have concerns about the mediation proposal currently made on the subject.  My first concern is that mediation is supposed to be one of the tools used after discussion has failed on the relevant article's discussion page. At this stage, the only person who appears steadfastly unable to posit views other than attacks on editors and the fact he disagrees with them (a discussion requires that you express your reasons why, and address the reasons given by the people who have opposing views) is jdchamp. A better position at this point would be to ask jdchamp to participate fully in the discussion on the Talk: page of the appropriate article. I have contributed my views to that discussion page multiple times in the last two weeks, and given my reasons for my beliefs. I have done also said that I believe this is the most appropriate action at this stage to jdchamp, and to TruSilver, the admin jdchamp has involved in the dispute about what is going on there. Unfortunately, he has instead repeatedly posted the same comments over and over again to my talk: page, varying from false accusations of bad conduct from me, to expressing a willingness to discuss the article (yet, for some reason, not followed by actual action on his part.)  Mediation only makes sense if the parties involved continue to have a dispute that's based upon a genuine difference of opinion after proper discussion. While that different of opinion might exist at this point, unless jdchamp actually expresses his differing opinion fully (as in, gives valid reasons and challenges the reasons his opponents give with legitimate arguments), there has been no discussion, and therefore going on to the next stage of dispute resolution seems premature.  My second concern, and believe me I'm not happy in saying this, is that I have concerns about TruSilver as the mediator. Please do not take anything I say about this as assuming bad faith, I'm absolutely sure TruSilver thinks what he's done is right: but that said, I don't trust his judgment on this issue, based upon an on-going harassment campaign leveled against me by jdchamp. TruSilver has consistently misrepresented my actions while doing little to challenge jdchamp's on-going campaign. In particular:  * TruSilver has accused me of using his talk: page to continue my apparent argument with jdchamp. This is untrue: I have only ever posted once to TruSilver's talk: page, posting an apology for the fact he'd been involved in the mess and expressing my concern about it. After it became obvious that jdchamp was posting at the same time, and challenging my comments about my personal state of mind, I made the decision to not post there again.  * TruSilver has accused me of refusing to discuss jdchamp's differences with me, these differences concerning the Mobile Phone Companies template. This is also manifestly untrue. I have have been a full participant in the discussion on that page's Talk: page, even participating in a poll that I believe was posted prematurely, arguing why I believe what I do and suggesting compromise solutions that might suit all parties. I have removed jdchamp's vandalism of my page, which in some cases involved posting claims that he was \"\"willing to discuss\"\" various issues, but were neither posted in the correct place, nor actual discussions of those issues.  * TruSilver has also leveled unnecessary personal attacks on me, accusing me of being dysfunctional, and of disruptiveness, edit warring, and incivility. With the possible exception of my (pretty justified) expression of frustration last night, nothing I've done of late fits the latter category, and the nearest thing I've done that comes to \"\"edit warring\"\" consists of removing spam that has been repeatedly added to my page by jdchamp. The other comments are just plain insulting and wrong.  I've suffered a sustained campaign of harassment against me for most of the last 15 days. I asked for help, and instead the admin who put his hand up has essentially acted as an enabler for the person harassing me. Other than an ultimately unenforced threat to block jdchamp if he continued to spam WP:AIV with inappropriate demands I be blocked, nothing has been done to encourage jdchamp to tone down his behavior, and as he showed last night with three warnings, and multiple reverts on my Talk: page, his behavior remains as bad as ever.  While I'm sure TruSilver has acted in what he believes is the most appropriate way given the facts immediately available to him, I don't believe he h	14868

This article sphere is infamous for various problems and I think rather that eds, the problem is due to the failure of adminning process whereby articles are supposed to be adminned by uninvolved admins, rather than a small group of involved admins. If some admin is taking continuous interest in one particular area of articles, they must be having some kind of involvement/interest in the content in that area. That is not respectable adminning and will clearly lead to problems, as indeed it is here. It creates a situation where eds from only one particular orientation will have paramount power on article content and the eds on the other side will get butchered. I do not think this article sphere has any problems that do not exist in other article spheres. Other admins are being kept away by the continuous propaganda that this sphere is problematic and a small band of involved admins continues to occupy \"\"their turf\"\".

You username of Raja tells me that you are neither of Pakhtun, Tanoli or Hazara/NWPF origin.

0	:This is a very inaccurate and well poisoning characterization.  I am biologist with a strong background in philosophy, mainly focused on ethics but of course broadly on metaphysics, epistemology and political philosophy as well. At this point in my life I've gone back to school specifically to get a degree in philosophy and no longer even work as a scientist, so for you to cast aspersions of scientism is wholly unfounded.   :I don't think Dawkins should be called a philosopher for two reasons: 1. He is not referred to as such in philosophical publications, at least not enough that it is justifiable to call him a philosopher outright per WP:V, and 2. He does not work within the traditions of any established academic disciplines of philosophy.  That is, he does not attempt to deconstruct language so as to understand and analyze its meaning and to subsequently determine - through rigorous logic - the truth or falsity of propositions, as he would if he practiced analytical philosophy.  Nor does he fit into the traditions - however broad - of continental philosophy.  Granted, he does write about subjects that are within the pursue of philosophy, but he does not do so in a philosophical style.  Now, I'll fully admit that the there is a sort of Demarcation problem here, and so my second point should only be considered an aside to the first point. On my first point, I'd be happy to include it in the article if Dawkins was characterized as a philosopher by a more than a couple mainstream, philosophical journals or by a substantial number of mainstream, academically practicing philosophers. 	15343

The hardness of pearl is lower, if when the pearl turns to yellow and loses its luster, you can use available from 1% to 1.5% of hydrogen peroxide to bleach, be careful not to bleach too far, otherwise it will lose its luster.  You'd better clean it by sheepskin or delicate flannelette and then you can put it away after wear pearl each time. Do not use the surface paper, because the friction of some paper will wear the pearl.  Don’t use water for cleaning either, because water can enter the holes and will be hard to dry, also, it might make the pearls ferment inside and turn the line into green.  When you wear out a lot of sweat, wet towels can be used carefully and put it back to jewelry box back after natural drying. Occasionally, clean it by fresh-saline water, and keep the moist of pearl.  Only give yours pearl accessories best care, they can bloom the most dazzling gloss.\"	15404

0	\"  ::Damn, I'm not getting notified about these talk-page messages. Do you know how I switch email notifications on for such responses? Yes, I've done a lot of work there, but am tightly constrained in how much I can reveal regarding the sources of any so-called \"\"original research\"\" material. Suffice it to say that I was privileged to work in the Dept of Physics at Auckland University (NZ), aged 19, as a research assistant (40+ years ago), where I made friends with a few young doctoral students, one of whom was researching gravitational waves. I then studied physics at the University of Canterbury, under Prof. Roy Kerr, the rotating black hole theorist. I've kept in touch with a few of those guys over the years, and they've introduced me to certain other \"\"big names\"\" in physics. I bailed out of the academy before gaining a doctorate, preferring a broad interdisciplinary education, and disgusted by the stress, pressure, politics, and the close-minded arrogance of certain professional academics. I had a fun life instead, and followed my curiosity about gravitation, astrophysics and cosmology in a totally relaxed way. Over the past decade or so, I've been privy to hearing about some very exciting developments in theoretical physics, particularly with regards to the unification problem. I can't say too much, because *cough* Nobel *cough*. If, just saying, somebody (hypothetically) had actually nailed the spin-2 boson, but hadn't yet published anything until it's mathematically robust, peer-reviewed, etc, then it's (hypothetically) highly likely that the solution would involve a mathematical toolkit comprising complex dimensional analysis, multi-dimensional special & general relativity, loop quantum gravity, E8 Theory, etc. Just wildly speculating here, but it's the 100th anniversary of Einstein's publication of GR — could be a very big year for physics.

But if you step into a good classy restaurant in Iran, or anywhere else, doogh is not carbonated and is homemade.  In homes, people often make and drink the homemade uncarbonated version, unless they buy it from the grocery shop or something.  This also applies to outside Iran.

0	\"  == Walking in on the middle of an argument ==  Thanks for the message, however the analogy you've chosen is incorrect, when I walk in on an argument then I cannot have heard what has happened before, however on a talk page I can read the whole thing and trace any talk page discussion. When I posted my first question was intentionally dumbed down, as if I didn't know what was going on, then as the replies came in I could respond to them. In terms of NPOV in articles this is how I see it; for example, person A writes and article which contains the phrase \"\"Scientology is bad\"\", there is then an article written about Person A, Mr A was born in..., and on..., and live with..., et cetera. Then under his work it says \"\"He wrote an article saying 'Scientology is Bad'\"\". I could not in all conscience remove that statement from the article, because the bias is from the speaker not the editor. The gist of the talk page on WP:SCN was that any negative comments which had been quoted accurately but were negative should be \"\"balanced\"\" out. And that is not something I could let happen.  \"	15469

First, the basis of the website is the VoteMatch quiz (I'll be adding a paragraph about that next weekend for the Notability discussion)  that is based on a Libertarian Party favorite called the Nolan Chart. Unlike the Nolan Chart, which is arranged as a [[push poll] to promote libertarianism, we arrange VoteMatch so that conservatives and liberals have the same number of \"\"yes\"\" answers. Furthermore, if you look at who OnTheIssues covers, it scrupulously includes liberals, conservatives, libertarians, greens, and far more right-leaning AND left-leaning candidates than the mainstream press does. FYI, I get incoming email accusing OnTheIssues of being left-leaning about as often as an accusation of being right-leaning. My response is always to challenge the write to find better coverage of right-leaning candidates on Fox News, or to find better coverage of left-leaning candidates on CNN  the mainstream media on BOTH sides cover their OWN candidates' issue stances less than OnTheIssues does! If that's \"\"leaning\"\", then I guess OnTheIssues leans  but I'd call it \"\"good journalism!\"\"   23:08, 4 March 2014\"	15497

0	\" {{unblock|reason=Your reason here ~~ Okay, here's what you need to do to prove a point on Wikipedia and to request a positive change. Look back at the history of revisions on the Beat Generation page back to between the summer of 2006 and the fall of 2008. I literally created the entire section of the page called \"\"cultural context\"\" and wrote most of it. I wrote the section now called \"\"writers\"\"  which I don't believe is accurately named, but that's another issue  as a section called \"\"usage\"\". Look at the Allen Ginsberg page. My intentions are positive; up until my antagonization of Tao, I have been cordial and have worked in a postive direction for over four years. What I want is the truth. What I want is accuracy on pages. That's what drives me in situations like this. Blocking me is not working toward the end of improving Wikipedia. Please actually listen to me  and I mean actually listen to me. Don't scan. Read carefully. I urge you once again, read the \"\"Formal argument edition\"\" entry and the \"\"get down to business entry\"\". Please actually read it. If I'm wasting your time, you are not doing your actual job and your blocking becomes meaningless  what if a police officer threw someone in jail and then claimed he didn't have the time to do the investigation? That would completely invalidate the judgement, especially when so much of the evidence in this case has been completely ignored. You claim I was dishonest in creating my sockpuppet; I was nothing but honest. Your claims demonstrate a lack of concern to find the actual truth in this situation, so I urge you, please, consider the actual truth carefully.  This is a genuine appeal because at this point I think the blocking represents a total absence of justice. I promise to not attack Tao or anyone else ever again and comply by the rules. Being blocked was fun but it got boring quickly. Now that that motivation is gone, I have no motivation to try to get blocked again. I swear to you. If you do your job, actually read what I'm saying, and consider this very seriously, I believe you'll find there is no good reason to block me beyond the original punitive length. Thank you for your time.  \"	15542

0	\"    Since this is not an article, but a sandbox draft, I don't know what to edit. I'll edit it here:  Note: You *almost got it right* but, the subject of the article is not the term, but the myth (or, shall we say controversy) about the term. The *argument* should be the subject.   \"\"Democrat Party\"\" is a term used in the United States instead of \"\"Democratic Party\"\" when referring to the Democratic National Committee. http://www.democrats.org/about/faq.html There is an ongoing dispute about the origins of this shorthand term, whether it is a natural shorthand expression, or whether it is derogatory to the party. A 1984 New York Times article suggested Republicans began to use the term when Democrats used their party name to infer \"\"they are the only true adherents of democracy.\"\"[1] New Yorker commentator Hendrik Hertzberg wrote that the term \"\"is a slur intended to ... express contempt.\"\"[2] He also stated that polling however indicated only \"\"deeply committed\"\" Democrats found the term offensive.[2] Political analyst Charlie Cook attributed use of the term to force of habit rather than a deliberate epithet by Republicans.[3] Ruth Marcus stated that Republicans likely only continue to employ the term because Democrats dislike it.[2] Hertzberg and Marcus both state the use of the term is \"\"trivial\"\".[2][3] [4]  History of usage The earliest known use of the term, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, was by a London stock-market analyst, who wrote in 1890, \"\"Whether a little farmer from South Carolina named Tillman is going to rule the Democrat Party in America – yet it is this, and not output, on which the proximate value of silver depends.\"\"[5]  William Safire in [year] wrote about the use of the term, understood as a derogatory reference, and attributed it to Thomas Dewey who he credits with this usage.[6] The term gained popularity during the 1940 presidential campaign of Wendell Wilkie. Wilkie's campaign manager Harold Stassen said, regarding his use in the 1940s, that because the Democratic Party was controlled \"\"by Hague in New Jersey, Pendergast in Missouri and Kelly-Nash in Chicago, [it] should not be called a 'Democratic Party.' It should be called the 'Democrat Party.'\"\"[7]  Do you see the difference?

0	\"  ==Some nuances and an unsettled question== I've tried to tone down some statements that seemed to me potentially exaggerated.  For example, the lede described EJ as an adviser to Presidents FDR and LBJ, but the main text did not fully support this statement, relating rather that (a) for a time, his work was read with interest by some in the Roosevelt White House, and (b) he informally advised Johnson while he was in Congress. There were also phrases that seemed a bit loosely applied, and/or POV in nature (e.g., describing FDR's fiscal policy as \"\"hyperactive\"\" I think fails the POV test).   I'm further troubled by the statements about EJ's purported anticipation of the rural S&L; crisis, but not sure I quite know enough on the subject to actually make changes (I've instead requested sourcing).  Two points of concern: (a) I'm not sure how relevant it is to predict in the mid-1970s a credit crunch that does not arrive until a decade later (also, to what extent his line of reasoning was accurate  i.e., did the cruch arrive due to factors that he identified, or for quite different reasons?), (b) the article currently relates that the credit crunch \"\"resulted in the savings and loan industry's troubles throughout farm country\"\".  Is this accurate, or would it be closer to the truth to say that it resulted \"\"from\"\" the S&Ls;' troubles?  Not my field of specialization: maybe someone else can take a lok at this passage?   \"	15738

Also, he apparently doesn't know as much relevant law as I do, even if he did attend two years of law school.  What I left on his user page was not a specific threat aimed at him.  Hell, it wasn't even a threat.  It was a description of my feelings.  Also he apparently lives in Chicago, and I live in Southern West Virginia.  Threats across state lines are almost never followed up.  Cops have better things to do.  I could have told him I actually wanted to kill him, and the police still would not do anything.  Except offer a totally useless restraining order.  I guess I have the practical knowledge he lacks.  And if they did something, which is about as likely as me winning the next Powerball?  I'd just be placed in a mental hospital on a 72 hour hold, and that ain't no thang!  I chuckle, however, at the thought of a dishevelled cross dresser shambling into a police station reeking of BO and Mad Dog, Lubriderm and semen, and saying that someone threated to kill him.

0	\"  ===Paris RER===  Ehm, some comments about your Gare Aéroport Charles de Gaulle 1 RER edits: it's not a good idea to create a new article when there is already an article about the same subject. The naming convention for RER stations is \"\"X (Paris RER)\"\", except when the station is also used by regular trains (Transilien, TER or other), then we use \"\"Gare de X\"\". I just saw that you moved nearly all of the RER stations. Better discuss it before you introduce a new standard name.   If you're sure that no trains from Charles de Gaulle take the branch line to Robinson, you can change the \"\"type2\"\" field into \"\"B4\"\" instead of \"\"both\"\". But I checked it on the RATP website, and they do. I don't think it's very useful to show all the different options for the RER lines, some trains skip a few stations, or serve only part of the line. I think for the B line alone there are more than 20 variants.   \"	15766

What does any of this have to do with SWAT and Charles Whitman? As I pointed out in bold letters above, Swat was created as a result of the Watts Riots of 1965, almost a year before Whitman. That is not to say that Whitman would not be used later for techniques on how to deal with his type of scenario in the future, but Whitman was unknown to John Nelson and Daryl Gates in 1965. The \"\"notable events\"\" mentioned in the paragraph in the article, came after Whitman, but SWAT was fully funded and implemented at those times. Whitman was not a factor in 1965, nor the \"\"Black Panthers\"\", \"\"SLA\"\" or any other SWAT related issues. Is Whitman used by SWAT as a teaching method? I know he is. There are other events that preceeded Whitman, that are taught as well. The reference to SWAT in the Whitman article, is a misplaced reference, created by mis-informed sources.

Some history could be good but kept brief as it can easily get long winded with the different treaties - maybe just that it has its roots in the ECSC founded in 1952? History is a good context to start talking about something, the era of establishment -and age- reflects its nature and so on.

One just needs to go into the Sponza palace, the Ragusian state archive in Dubrovnik and see any of the official documents. The laws regarding inner policy are clearly stated in Croatian: Those regarding foreign policy are written both in Croatian and Italian. All of the ruling families of Ragusa from Sorkocevic to Gucetic to Restic etc were Croatian. The greatest Ragusian poet and writer Ivan Gundulic, an aristocrat and one of the rulers, famous for his book \"\"Suze sina razmetnoga\"\", was one of the greatest Croatian nationalists.  Source: \"\"Dubrovnik, a history\"\", written by Robin Harris 2006. According to the Robert Harris book Malta was independent until 1808 when Napoleon annexed it. According to Harris Dubrovnik with it's fleet of 700.000 tons (surpassing Venice in 1660) was the main hated rival of Venice in the Adriatic and always resisted the invasion plans of Venice. The last Venitian rector was sent home packing- politely but firmly- in 1351. According to Harris the recto packed his belongings in a hurry.  Some reflections  on this issue are necessary  First, it is necessary a reflection on the very concepts of Nation and State as these two terms are commonly considered near-synonyms and therefore used interchangeably. They have, instead different meanings. The term Italy refers to booth meanings. Italy as State was born in XIX cent, but Italy as Natiom is much older. Almost true, Ragusa never belonged to Italy-State except the Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy (1808-1809), but was seen for some centuries a part of Italy-Nation in the beginning of its birth process. Today Ragusa/Dubrovink, as well as Split and other Dalmatian towns, are out of Italy-State and out of Italy-Nation as well, they belong both to Croatia-Nation and to Croatia-State. On the other hand Lugano (Switzerland) and San Marino (independent republic) are out of Italy-State and still part of Italy-Nation. I suggest the book: L. TOMAZ, \"\"Il confine d'Italia in Istria e Dalmazia. Duemila anni di storia\"\" and the SSRN working paper: ARNALDO MAURI, Historical, Geopolitical and Economic Factors affecting State and Nation Boundaries: Foreword on Italy's Borders in Istria and Dalmatia.,  Of course, Ragusa as port city had a multiethnic population: besides Italians also Croats, Vlachs, Serbs, Albanians. Similar situations could be found in Istanbul, Alexandria, Izmir, Odessa. To be the birthplace of poets or outstanding men is insignificant. Tommaseo was born in Dalmatia, as many other great Italians, Garibaldi and Massena were born in Nice, the Greek poet Kavafis in Alexandria. Venice was rival of Ragusa, but was also rival of Genoa on the sea and of Milan on the mainland; also this point is insignificant to the discussion on Ragusa belonging to Italy-Nation in past centuries.    ==Romanians in 2007/2008==  I think now that Romanians are the largest minority in Italy, someone should add this fact from this year.   :If you can give a reliable source that says this, go ahead and add it (including a reference to the source).

0	== Souther desert ==  I saw the reports. There definetly is some kind of fighting in the south. However, I still advise to be on the side of caution. No I don't think it should be combined to the Sabha clashes article (which I still think wasn't a too big of an event to warrant an article of its own) because that is a separate event from a month ago. And my reason that I am advising caution about the reports is that for now only the Wall street journal and a Spanish media outlet have reported on the possible story. No other mainstream media has reported on it. And again the everlasting propaganda war of this civil war. The rebels claimed to had compleat control of Brega for three days straight until they admited to control only a third of the town (and plus there are sporadic clashes in the areas of the town they claim to control). So I am again sceptical about this claim also.   	16125

0	== Forthcoming Changes, Outline ==  The group of students at the University of British Columbia editing this wikipedia entry have tentatively decided on the following as an outline for the entry:  == History ==  The purpose of this introductory section is to give the readers an insight and understanding of the background history of Hells Gate and its indigenous inhabitants. The First Nations people used Hells Gate as a prime salmon fishing ground, and because of this, it became one of many locations for a popular fish station. I also discuss the environmental reasoning (deglaciation) behind the presence of salmon, and subsequently indigenous people in the Fraser Canyon and Hells Gate area.    === Hells Gate Slide === This section will focus on the Hells Gate Slide itself, beginning with the construction of the Canadian Northern Railway which spurred the slide. It will discuss how human impact and the slide changed the water ecology and what measures were initially taken in order to solve the issue.    === Environmental Impacts ===  The main focus of this section would be damage to the local environment due to the slide. It would address the impact the Hells Gate slide had on the fish habitat, particularly focusing on the sockeye salmon runs disruption. It would then explore the decline in the salmon population due to the incident and would focus on the relocation of the salmon, which was unable to reach the spawning grounds, into other rivers.     === Social and Political Impacts === In this section we will look at the social impacts on the native fisheries and on the commercial fisheries that happened as a result of the hells gate slide.  === The International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission (IPSFC === Here I'll discuss how the Commission came to be, what it was comprised of, who was in it, how it functioned, etc. also their research (although this may go in the next section). This section may be relatively small, as there is already an existing entry on the Commission.  === International Dispute === Discuss the disputed research methods and conclusions, and the escalating conflict === Government Response === This section will deal with the response to the slide - building of fishways, etc. == Today == The current situation of Hells Gate and the Fraser River == Aerial Tramway == Existing	16208
0	== Request for Comments ==  We seem to be deadlocked on the naming issue; for which I am happy to accept some of the blame.

1	== Everything Zimmerman Claimed has been Backed up by Facts - The IDIOT Trayon Supporters? Not so much ==  Armed with the medical reports, we KNOW who was screaming for help. It was Zimmerman who was JUMPED for NO GOOD REASON by a thuggish known weed dealin, chronic weed smoking, bus driver assaultin, jewel thievin, MULTIPLY suspended PUNK who referred to HIMSELF publicly as a TRUE...er...Negro!  All Trayvon had to do is call the cops if he was soooo scared.   The cops did NOT tell Zimmerman NOT to follow him. There's a HUGE diff btw a 911 operator and a cop. Telling someone 'we don't need you to do that' is NOT the same as a direct order and finally, Zimmmerman claims he DID stop following at that point.  If EIGHT BLACK TEENS were CAUGHT robbing people in that neighborhood, not to mention the ones that didn't get caught, then you'd have to be an IDIOT to not eyeball someone acting as suspiciously as Trayvon. For all we know, he could have robbed someone in the sub in one of his visits. We know the cops said he had a jewel-thieving tool.   Oh that's right, the cops are not to be trusted. Except when they tell you 'We don't need you to do that.' Then you MUST obey! lol  The DOCTORED NBC audio...the INCESSANT pure BS claims that an innocent kid armed only with skittles and an iced tea was shot in an UNPROVOKED manner.

0	===Timeline for unblock request=== Although I have created articles and templates in the past, and participated in various wikiprojects, nowadays I tend to restrict myself to correcting errors in Wikipedia, mostly spelling and date format issues (because they are easy to find and fix) and removing polemic from political articles. Both are enjoyable and useful activities. Wikipedia's articles on politics, religion and sex are magnets for POV warriors. I'm liberal on sex, tolerant on religion, but on politics I know my stuff and I detest seeing articles slanted one way or another by POV-warriors, who change useful resources into propaganda. I'm a taxidriver doing a twelve hour night shift, so my time for editing Wikipedia is limited. However, I've recently begun taking my laptop with me, and squeezing in a bit of wikiwork between customers. This usually amounts to a few minutes here and there, and I'm often forced to close down suddenly as I move up to the head of the rank. This is significant in what follows.	16308

If I wrote in the value-form article I created that \"\"Thus, Marx aims to provide a brief morphology of the category of economic value as such, from the simplest forms to the money-form.\"\" that is perfectly accurate and neutral. Because that is in fact what it is. It is not controversial at all. By contrast, your arbitrary vandalism of other's texts has nothing to do with accuracy and neutrality, but with your own perceptions, biases and prejudices what is acceptable or preferable. You are fighting your own propaganda war in wikipedia, as shown exactly by what you deleted and added across time. That's bad, but what makes it worse is two things: the evidence is that you frequently have no real experience or competency with regard to the subjectmatter, and you provide no satisfactory explanations or discussions for cutting out very large parts of texts from articles written by others.

I know many people have their edits reverted quickly, so I'm not going to bother spending lots of time on edits which will be reverted quickly. My method is fast and effecient - it just takes me a few minutes, and by hitting 20 pages, by the time someone reverts everything, there'll be some passing readers who will see my work and see how Microsoft cheats people.  I'm going to check with SingNet whether they offer shared IPs - if so, I'll sign up for an account with them. I have a friend who uses AOL who would be interested in helping me with this. Perhaps if we have 10 ISPs which use dynamic IPs or IPs shared by thousands of people, and we keep doing this, anonymous editing will have to be completely prohibited.

In my personal life I try to build the sport of curling, which is what brought me here, to build a database for the sport. I hope you noticed that when my friend commented on the curlingbox talkpage, Prayerfortheworld was so willing to work with that user, wanted to know how to make the template(s) better. Yet when I made any suggestion it was negatively received and ignored, with no suggestions or personal input. I told you from the beginning, that user had personal issues with me that went beyond the curlingbox, and you didn't believe me. The end result, I've been banned from doing the editing that I love, for the sport I love and am trying to build.  This is a rather unfortunate, unsettling and upsetting situation.

0	\"  == Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the city ==  Dear Salvio,  You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.  May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2  and Chesdovi) are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.  There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag, that is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.  It is totally UNACCEP LE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND  at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on \"\"North Nicosia\"\" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.   This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the   Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.   In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an \"\"encyclopedic\"\" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.    \"	16740

We have a regular situation where a NFC (or simply WP-hosted) image is removed from an article, GF or vandalism, and within moments it's then tagged for CSD as unused. There is no attempt to manually check if it ought to be used, or even if there's still a FUR in place pointing to an article from which it has just been vandalised.

Otherwise, you will not find the friends with you when you need them, and believe me, you will need friends a lot sooner than you think.

0	\"  == Accuracy of 'quarrel' quote ==  According to Ralph Keyes, the quote in the article \"\"I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong... No Viet Cong ever called me nigger\"\" is a misquotation.  Keyes says: When Muhammad Ali refused induction into the Army, he was widely quoted as saying, “No Viet Cong ever called me nigger.” This was a perfect marriage of anti-war and anti-racist sentiment. Better yet, it came straight from the mouth of a mega-celebrity thought to possess primitive folk wisdom. The only problem is that Ali never made this comment. “It’s wasn’t really his mind-set to say something in that way,” explained Ali biographer Thomas Hauser. “The companion thought of that comment is ‘people call me nigger in this country every day.’ I never heard Ali say ‘white people in this country call me nigger.’ He would attack racism. But he wouldn’t personalize it.” Despite extensive searching by himself and others, Hauser has never found the source of “no Viet Cong ever called me nigger.” He concluded that it was just one of those things that got picked up and passed around in the 60s. It was a comment we wanted Ali to make so badly that we made it for him.\"	17052

Naval Special Warfare is committed to fielding a force that represents the demographics of the nation it serves. This contract initiative seeks effective strategies to introduce high potential candidates from diverse backgrounds to the opportunities available in Naval Special Warfare.

I said small would be more appropriate relative to \"\"minor\"\" - \"\"\"\"Minor\"\" reflects a point of view. \"\"Small\"\" would be more appropriate.\"\"  Most appropriate would be to not have any modifier.  If the split was so minor, why are so many people still ticked off about it?  And it's not fair to say that the RSF folks left the movement, they just continued pursuing a direction they had pursued for years.  The \"\"movement\"\" is bigger than PSF and PIRA.  2. I did not state that Peter Taylor is a \"\"mere journalist.\"\"  If I did, my apologies to Peter Taylor.  Indeed, please point it out where I used the phrase \"\"mere journalist.\"\"   I did state that he has written some excellent books.  For better or worse, historians are not journalists.  They have different schools for each, in fact.  Provos accompanied a documentary broadcast; it's a great publication, but it's not a detailed history of the Provisional IRA.  The wikiepedia entry for Peter Taylor states, \"\"Peter Taylor born Scarborough, North Yorkshire is a British journalist and documentary-maker who had covered for many years the political and armed conflict in Northern Ireland, the so-called Troubles. From his experience he has written and produced books and television documentaries on the Northern Irish conflict.\"\"  The entry for J. Bowyer Bell states, \"\"The Troubles began in Northern Ireland in 1969, and Bell's The Secret Army: the IRA 1916-1970 was published the following year, and was one of the first detailed histories of the IRA along with The IRA by Tim Pat Coogan which was also published in 1970.\"\"  Many of the people that Taylor interviewed were also interviewed by Bell; and Bell probably interviewed them first and, in some cases, more than once (though Taylor probably interviewed several people multiple times, too).    3. One Night In Hackney states above that he \"\" wasn't using one source over another, I was using what the source actually said.\"\"  But Bell clearly states, as noted above, \"\"Ruairi O Bradaigh, Daithi O Conaill, and about one hundred others walked out to form Republican Sinn Fein.\"\"  So, the sources disagree.  At one point, I believe, the word \"\"twenty\"\" was in there.  It is not in there now, and from my view this is appropriate.  If the sources disagree we should not choose one over the other, but instead we should either acknowledge the differences and quote from each or find a way to be neutral  not quoting from either.  4. Once again there has been a dispute in which One Night in Hackney has chosen one source over another and then when confronted with a direct quotation from an alternate source he has chosen to ask questions, change the subject, and deny the validity of the source.  The reality is that Taylor and Bell are both valid sources, and Bell was clearly talking about people walking out of the Ard-Fheis.  Bell might have been wrong, Taylor might be wrong, but we as Wikipedia editors are not in a position to make that determination.  To do so is to engage in Original Research. WH.     [edit]\"	17319

0	And   :Paganism  :Southgate, who has a degree in theology and religious studies from Canterbury University, rejected Catholicism and moved towards neo-pagan and heathen groups that are ‘very loyal to the Gods of the Northern Tradition’, including the Odinic Rite, the Tribe of the Wulfings and the A ´ satru´ Alliance, a pagan movement concerned with practising rituals and magic and led by Valguard (Mike) Murray, a former member of the American Nazi Party.91 Further evidence of this transition from Catholicism to paganism emerged in an interview with Wotan, the organ of the Charlemagne Hammer Skins.92 Southgate believed that Wotan’s celebration of the heroes of the Norse pantheon represented ‘the most genuine expression of European spirituality, culture and identity’.93 Another key expression of this ‘identity’ is exhibited by Southgate’s interest in the militaristic cult of Mithras and the ‘pagan spirituality’ of the apostate Roman emperor Julian II.94  :This rejection of Christianity has an avowedly antisemitic dimension. Through the figure of Christ, Christianity has Judaic roots and is therefore irredeemably tainted; only the ‘weak’ continue to worship a ‘dead Jew’.95 The emphasis on the Judaic roots of Christianity, however, is regarded as of secondary importance to its usurpation of the rituals, sacraments and hierarchy of the ancient pagan solar religion Mithras, which was introduced into Iran and India by marauding Aryan tribes from the Russian steppes between BCE 2000 and 1500 before spreading to the Roman empire. Although it failed to defeat early Christianity in the battle for religious supremacy during the fourth century, Mithras continues to be viewed by esoteric thinkers (including Evola and Jung) as an alternative path the West could have followed. It retains its appeal as an initiatory cult or aristocratic order akin to the Knights Templar or, latterly, Himmler’s SS which, the NRF claims, had its origins in various ‘Anarchist droite ’ circles l e the Black Sun and the Thule Society. While Christianity tried to neuter this vital expression of the ‘Aryan psyche’, the awareness of Europe’s ‘Faustian’ destiny is currently enjoying a renaissance within the occult milieu. These ideas were also absorbed by thinkers like Evola and Rene´ Gue´non who discerned in them the fragments of a ‘hidden albeit distinct and fundamental truth’.96 For Southgate, as for Evola, Tradition is an ‘an underlying current which both permeates and transcends all’.97  :Southgate’s discovery of Evolian ‘Primordial Tradition’ and his consequent rejection of Catholicism as ‘the sole cosmological truth’ ran in tandem with his immersion in the industrial music scene.98 This ‘cultural vanguard’ is spearheaded by a number of Gothic-Industrial, Dark Ambient, Black and ‘Viking’ Metal bands, including Allerseelen, Blood Axis, Burzum, Current 93, Dark Holler, Death in June, Endura, Mayhem, Ostara, Puissance and Sol Invictus, though it also encompasses more commercial bands like Cradle of Filth.99 Although it would be an exaggeration to say that these groups conform to a defined political agenda, their music serves to diffuse the ideals of Mithraic paganism and Nordic folk myths within this youthful underground subculture far more effectively than any number of meetings and marches could, thus providing the ‘perfect antidote’ to the spiritually enervating, multiracial values of a globalizing ‘system’. Southgate has also noted the potential of the Straight Edge punk movement and its hard core of puritanically intolerant followers, an interesting development given (exaggerated) reports of an emerging ‘anti-anti-establishment’ pro-Bush right-wing punk movement.100 Although Southgate realizes that the groupuscular right cannot control music-orientated youth cultures, he believes a minority can be induced ‘to take a direction basically conducive to our aims’.101 Southgate seeks to do this through his online magazine Synthesis, which features a music section replete with interviews and gig reviews.102  :This is not simply cynical manipulation. Southgate appears genuinely interested in the counter culture he seeks to target. His fanzine, Tribal Resonance, ‘the voice of the racial avant-garde’, reveals Southgate’s strategy of linking his ideas to ‘the common language and the big ideas of our culture’.103 Through the medium of musical subcultures and the creation of alternatives ‘from without’, Southgate hopes to permeate existing political subcultures transversally, as the Nazis did, through a process of ‘cultural osmosis’ that aims to recode the ‘social symbology’ of the host culture so that its ideas can metastasize throughout the body politic, recalibrating its genetic inheritance. By creating ‘cultural hegemony’ the groupuscular right believes it can forge the ‘political space’ necessary for political and racial hegemony.104  :The struggle for cultural heg	17406

Nonbelievers in general - say, someone who's raised a Christian, believes the Bible is an allegory, and only attends church for a funeral or perhaps at Christmastime - tend to adopt a \"\"Whatever gets you through the night\"\" philosophy and be quiet on matters of faith. It's sort of like the difference between a devout vegetarian and someone who hates the taste of meat. Atheists are proud of their hate.

The user is rarely using authoritative references but apparently only what turns up first on Google. I'd feel differently if the vandal were responding at all to any complaints or if the user weren't making dozens of similar edits each day. I've learned my lesson from you and I won't complain about this user again, and I certainly won't report any others that regularly trash WP with similar types of rumors and fake references, so I don't expect a reply from you, but I think you are making a serious mistake by not treating this as vandalism and immediately imposing restraints. —  	17698

Its former pop star Kerry Katona  Maybe that's the slogan they use now, but there is no doubt the slogan they used back in the day was \"\"That's why Mum's gone to Iceland\"\".    Still is - I went to an Iceland this morning and this slogan is still plastered everywhere (April 2007)  == Copyright issues ==  A lot of this article is directly copied from the Iceland website: http://www.iceland.co.uk/ice/instore.nsf/(websearch)/theicelandstory as indicated by the fact that there are still asterisks inserted which do not relate to anything within the article, but rather to notes on the original page. Is it possible that Iceland have approved this copy?    :Almost certainly not. If it was, there'd be some WP:OTRS tag on this page or something else saying that it was legit. As it is I've removed it for its blatancy.    ==Name change== It's my understanding that the overall name \"\"Iceland.co.uk\"\" was dropped as a result of the dotcom bubble bursting - the suggestion being that associating a company so totally with t'internet around 2001-2 was stock market poison. ==Fair use rationale for Image:Iceland Shop Logo.gif==  :Image:Iceland Shop Logo.gif is being used on this article. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in this Wikipedia article constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.  Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.  If there is other other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.  Note that any fair use images uploaded after 4 May, 2006, and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you.   == Iceland International Stores ==  I started out on this search knowing, without question, that there was an Iceland supermarket on the road between Mijas costa and Mijas pueblo in the Costa del sol in Spain. While merely \"\"knowing\"\" isn't good enough, it does permit of a longer search and of asking the company about non-UK/Ireland stores.

However, we do  not hold this information for these stores here. Please feel free therefore to visit www.overseas.es for further information.

As far as I can tell the page for  naming conventions of Greek and Turkish named places specifically states...   ::\"\"This Wikipedia page is currently inactive and is retained as a historical archive. Either the page is no longer relevant or consensus has become unclear. If you want to revive discussion regarding the subject, you should seek broader input via a forum such as the proposals page of the village pump.\"\"  Furthermore, I have to ask why is there suddenly a special page only for Greek/Turkish naming conventions in the first place? The standards proposed on that page appear to directly contridict broader Wikipedia naming standards which state...  ::Use modern English names for titles and in articles. Historical names or names in other languages can be used in the lead if they are frequently used and important enough to be valuable to readers, and should be used in articles with caution.

One example that springs to mind is Blender; the interface dictated that it was commercially unsuccesful, however, after being expanded upon by open-source development, the resultant software is still plagued by poor interface design that frustrates users, making it difficult to use the powerful software behind the interface.   Other problems worth noting could be the lack of documentation surrounding active development that makes it difficult to utilize a product to its full potential.  Perhaps this has already been mentioned, or there is a better forum for bringing it up; I myself am not well-versed or articulate enough to express a significant or valuable dialogue on the topic - I am merely aware that such criticisms exist and perhaps should be acknowledged.	17988

He did just the opposite, in fact.  He seems to be accusing the duo of modeling their pronouncements after standard talking points of the Democrats.  This is a far cry from comparing Bush to Hitler, for instance.    =France / Hip Hop Culture and the School Shoooting= His comment saying no one would care if France were nuked might be considered controversial, although it's proven not to be his \"\"nappy-headed ho's\"\" type career damaging statement.  Every section in the criticism section has created NO RIPPLE outside of the highly partisan sections of the blogosphere, aside form his comments on the school shooting (which was mentioned in a small circulation hip-hop magazine).  For the sake of comparission, I'd like to cite Chris Matthew's June 26th edition of \"\"Hardball\"\", where Ann Coulter was a guest.  After saying he was \"\"deeply concerned\"\" about people who think like Coulter, many of the members in the live audience cheered.  This caused Matthews to exclaim, \"\"My God, is this 'Deliverance'?\"\".  I personally criticize Matthews for comparing people to inbred hillbilly homosexual rapists (and not giving them a chance to defend themselves).  Yet, I'm not putting my criticism on Matthew's page.

0	\"  ==Re: The Chancers page== Hello there, and welcome to Wikipedia. To answer your question, Wikipedia has a notability guideline, which tries to distinguish between \"\"notable\"\" content (from Wikipedia point of view, a notable topic is one that can be included as article) and \"\"non notable\"\" (content that may be in the future included, but as of now, not). According to our specific music notability guidelines, in order to justify an article, a band needs to fulfill any of these points. From what you wrote in that page, none of those points were fulfilled. If the band passes any of those points, you can include an article in Wikipedia. However, note that you will have to give references for such achievement, otherwise it will be speedy deleted (deleted within minutes of creation because of lack of notability). Even if it fulfills a point, note that Wikipedians can send the article to deletion (either because the notability reference is found to be fake or disputed, unverifiable or otherwise non notable), where wikipedians will discuss if the article is indeed notable by our guidelines, and decide whether it is deleted or not. I hope this answers your question.   \"	18065

In that manner, I’m sorry if I made some personal attacks on FSF or if I was to fast and responded not courteously in some cases.  However, everything I did was done in order to have more appropriate article that will thoroughly describe Kumanovo. As I can see, the page is unprotected now and FSF returned the most of my new additions to the page (and I’m thankful for that). For now I’m not going to make any corrections on the current text and I will leave FSF to do it if he feels the necessity for that in order to finally shape the appropriate look of the article.  I would like to propose to FSF several minor changes on the current version which I think should be done in order to achieve further improvement of the article: * 1. I think the following geographical info should be moved from the Economy into the Overview section: Although Kumanovo lies 340 kilometers above the sea, it is surrounded by the Karadag part of Skopska Crna Gora mountain on its western side, Gradishtanska planina mountain on its southern side and Mangovica and German mountain on the eastern side. Kumanovo has a temperate climate. * 2. I still have doubt about the presence of private practice “Otodent” in the Culture section * 3. By my opinion, the last three sentences in the Culture section would be more appropriate in the History section. Thanks	18075

0	\"  ==Rock or pop?== I know it says rock and roll here, but the red album really does sound very teeny-popish. My music collection only has room for single genres (as in rock or pop, not rock/pop), so which one is it really?    It's rock    :Actully, it is pop not rock. I aggree with  that it sounds very teeny-popish. Rock and roll is the same thing as rock. I think a lot of people shorten it as it sounds a bit cooler.  |    == Many problems ==  In addition to three items I tagged as  that appear to contradict what I can verify about the album, the table smacks of OR, and even then, some of the info in the table is incorrect.  As far as I can determine, both 1962-1966 and 1967-1970 were compiled by Allan Steckler, an employee of ABKCO (Allen Klein's company), which at that time was managing Apple Records in the United States. The Beatles had no involvement whatsoever with any aspect of the albums. Indeed, they came out in the United States about two weeks before their UK release. Also, the two albums were compiled, at least in part, as a response to a heavily promoted bootleg, The Beatles Alpha Omega, a 4-record, 4-tape set that came out in 1972 and was even advertised on television in the U.S.; the boot's availabiliy made the point that there was no true \"\"greatest hits\"\" collection of the Beatles available in America at that time.    == Choice of the colour red ==  I have removed the claim that the Beatles chose the colour red for this album to show support for Liverpool F.C. Aside from the fact the other album is blue so we might as well suggest that indicates that they must be Evertonians, it's unsourced and extremely unlikely to be true. There has been a request for a source and none has been provided. In fact, there is no source for the claim that the Beatles helped select the tracks or helped with the album design at all (I seem to remember reading that McCartney did but not the others, though they may have done I suppose). Forgive me if I am wrong, but the suggestion that the Beatles picked red to show support for LFC sounds as though it's been made up by a Liverpool fan who either assumes this is the case or would like others to think it is. Some Liverpool fans like to proclaim that the Beatles were keen Liverpool supporters when in fact there is no evidence for this and almost certainly no truth to in it whatsover, and it's interesting that the contributer in question did not go over to 1967-1970 to make any similar reference to the choice of the colour blue indicating the Beatles' affection for Everton FC. Fact is, only one of the Beatles were even remotely interested in football (McCartney) and strictly speaking, he is an Evertonian (although he maintains he supports both clubs). Ringo, according to the Guardian, is an Arsenal fan. Neither George or John had any interest in football whatsoever and it is unknown which if any team they favoured, even there families don't know, although Harrison did seem to imply once that he supported Tranmere Rovers rather than Everton or Liverpool (Lennon added a Liverpool player, Albert Stubbins, to the Sgt. Pepper cover but later said he only did so because he knew he was his father's favourite player and that he himself actually knew nothing about Stubbs). There is a remote possibility that if the group were involved in the album's design that they may have chose red and blue in reference to the two Merseyside football clubs, but if it is so there should be a source for this and it should be made clear that this was not a show of support for one club over the other, which gives a false impression (whether intended or not).    : I agree.  |    == Unauthorized Beatles compilations before \"\"1962-1966\"\" ==  Hi, anonymous user here. I found out about a 4-LP set called \"\"Alpha Omega\"\" that was a Beatles compilation sold through infomercials back in 1972 that supposedly got EMI to compile the hits onto \"\"1962-1966\"\" and \"\"1967-1970\"\". But some people claim that the \"\"Alpha Omega\"\" set was withdrawn from the markets since it wasn't legitimate.  Does anyone else know about this?     ==	18083

0	\"  == Scarborough Nicknames ==  While I don't really want to expand on this section, there are in fact some web references to Scompton:  *You know you're from Scarborugh when... *Busta Rules  There is also a wikipedia page called Canadian slang which references Scompton as well as a couple of other nicknames not mentioned in the Scarborough article. I used Clusty search engine to find these references. Up to you whether you want to put this reference back. I don't care one way or the other.  Regards,    *You're absolutely correct.  Serves me right for editing before my first cup of coffee in the morning.  I found nothing relevant for Scompton, but when I redid the search later, I did get results thru a search for Scompton AND Scarborough. I ought not to have deleted the entry based on a Google search turning up nothing.Personally, I generally don't see any value in having a section for nicknames for the municipality.  But there is obviously precedent for having it (e.g. Toronto).  The problem I have with these sections is that they end up including obvious entries (like \"\"Hogtown\"\" for Toronto), but then also up end up including nicknames that may be used in some circles but don't have particularly wide usage.  The particular problem here in the Scarborough article is that so many of the nicknames have such a negative connotation  perhaps that's just a reflection of public perception, but I do believe that it does, to a degree, give the reader the wrong impression of the place.  Frankly, I am just waiting for someone to add \"\"Scandahar\"\" to the list. I'm not from Scarborough, so I will leave the list in the hands of folks who have a better sense of whether its inclusion is justified.  Given your edits to the article, you are probably better placed to make that call than I. Cheers,  \"	18344

Most people only read the intro, either because they are too lazy or too unwilling to scrutinize their prejudiced views; and an equivocal intro panders exactly to those types of readers, encouraging them. The intro should be built in such a way that fairly represents the two main popular opposing views of Saddam: as a brutal dictator, regional threat of WMD and terrorism, vs. freedom fighter / modern Sallah a-Din whatever his supporters want to call it.  It does the latter but not the former. Yes, you cannot avoid the possible reader conclusion that Saddam's popular support may not be despite his brutality but because of it; This is one of the legitimate paradoxes sorrounding this figure (and that of most dictators).\"	18506

0	\"   It says to use secondary sources primarily, not exclusively.  Besides it being a rather obvious, observable fact that the new street lights are brighter, we have a reference in that they were claimed to be 'safer' (i.e., provide more light).   The fact that light pollution is increased with increased brightness is non-arguable, it'd be like saying you have to prove the sun is generally brighter at mid-day. Light pollution has to do with the amount of light used. Newer street light technology produces more light with less energy. The less energy part is great, it's the more light that has to do with light pollution.  How's this: In 2011, the City announced plans to upgrade 80% of its street lighting to new energy-efficient street lights which use induction technology, a modified form of fluorescent lamp that produces a broader spectrum than sodium-vapor lamps. The new system is predicted to save $2.2 million per year in energy and maintenance costs [37], and was proposed to \"\"make our neighborhoods safer\"\" [37] by producing more light, something that also increases [light pollution], while lowering [visual comfort probability]. Wikipedia. Retrieved February 7, 2014.  In 2014, San Diego announced plans to become the first U.S. city to install cyber-controlled street lighting, using an \"\"intelligent\"\" lighting system to control 3,000 LED street lights.[38]  ..(Side Note) I found several non-local references while searching for 'street lights controversy', one claimed a battle was 'raging' in communities across the nation, in places that were making the switch to brighter street lighting. It seems to mostly involve people calling and complaining - Complaints in San Diego held back further instillations along Harbor Drive, and the PR person I talked to said he had dealt with tons of complaints; And that was at an early stage of the upgrade. There's also a battle in Sacramento being waged to keep incandescent bulbs from being completely phased out (I wouldn't be surprised if it's not widely covered by the media), because they haven't come up with a non-toxic energy saving bulb (There actually was one being developed, and now I can't find any information about it). I know it to be controversial for many locals, but I can't provide online references, so I'm sticking to basic facts. (End Side Note)    \"	18758

I think a cooling off period would be good for her and since she has stated rather firmly on Talk:Bloodless bullfighting that she is giving up on the pictures then I think that will more or less happen by itself. Claiming to be constantly attacked or calling others disruptive is most certainly a personal attack and I trust that Metros will keep an eye on things, given that he is an admin. Calling Metros disruptive several times is definately a severe test of his patience. I think we have run out of options, the message you posted to her was the last attempt to resolve this in peace. If she turns around again and launches any personal attacks it is her own responsibility. If she decides to cool off and follow one of the three options outlined by us for solving this in peace and in accordance with policy then hopefully she can provide some constructive contributions. As long as the spam links are gone and the article remains tagged as POV until all views are represented I don't see a reason why it shouldn't be there.

0	\" :I'll have to take a closer look at the current version of the article, because I have an uneasy feeling that the answer actually is found in one of the subsidiary articles, such as Lydian mode. The short answer is that the connection between the Greek harmoniai and the medieval modes is more tenuous than you appear to believe, and the connection between medieval and modern modes is fairly straightforward. The \"\"modern system\"\" is actually that of Common Practice Tonality, and \"\"modal\"\" usage within that context begins to establish itself as a separate idea during the 18th century. The chief difference from medieval practice is a more rigid adherence to the diatonic notes of the scale. For example, in the medieval system, there is no practical difference between the Lydian scale and what we call the major scale, or between the Dorian and what we call the minor scale. In order to differentiate \"\"modal flavor\"\" from the chromatic flexibility of the upper half of the minor scale, for example, it became necessary to insist on always using the minor-seventh scale degree, especially in ascent to the tonic, and the sixth degree had to be always major to identify Dorian, and always minor to identify Aeolian. No such practice existed up to the 16th century, and indeed it was only with Glareanus in the mid-16th century that a theoretical difference was made between Dorian and Aeolian on the one hand, and Lydian and Ionian on the other. I shall see what I can do to clear this up (using reliable sources, of course).—  \"	18985

If she had lived, her acting career may have fizzled to nothing, but she didn't live, and that's the whole point.

0	*The Table of Sacrifices is an artifact summoned by the Three Sacks in order to raise the Yamiking (and likewise, Hydrate) to the surface.  Typically, a being from the Reverse Maruhage can only individually teleport back and forth between dimensions (we see when Crimson, LOVE and the Sacks return to the Dark World, they use a teleporter that allows them to raise and fall between the surface).  My assumption is that an object such as the Yamiking needs a lot of energy to rise up to the main world compared to the limited amount of energy that individuals can use.  Thus, the Table of Sacrifices is needed to gather energy from twelve individuals (in the form of a clock) to power the Yamiking.  After the Sacks summon the clock, Crimson and LOVE throw over defeated opponents (already known to be really strong since they made it to the final stage of the playoff) into each number, with the assumption that their great energy will siphon from the clock to the Yamiking. - 	19086

What does it mean? Well, I can understand that it may be difficult to determine the profitability of high frequency trading, by why is it a main issue? Note also that this is an article on algorithmic trading generally, not specifically high frequency trading. Furthermore, this confusing sentence is followed by another one about the income generated by some 300 hedge funds and other participants. I have no idea what to say about this amount - is it a lot of money or not. Also anyway, if we have this number available, then why is it a difficulty to determine the profitability of HFT?    	19197

0	\":Hi there. Thanks for your concern on the matter. I can assure you this has little to nothing to do with \"\"mathematician vs physicist\"\" as you have proposed; it, instead, has everything to do with Linas incompetence. It is univerally acknowledged that a complex function SQUARED can be negative. This is nothing new or exciting: consider f(x) = i if you don't believe me. The square modulus of a wavefunction is what the probability defined in the context of wavefunctions.   :Remarkably, someone who pretends he is so knowledgeable in mathematics and physics - indeed, even stating to me that I do not know Quantum Mechanics and hence should not edit articles - could make such a terrible fumble. Without saying it for effect, his lack of understanding between the square modulus and the square of a complex number if a lack of understanding of day one material: literally, my Complex Analysis book (by Conway, Graduate Texts in Mathematics series) covers it in the first section, and again literally, my mathematical physics course as an undergraduate covered this on the first day of class.  :Linas, you are incompetent. People tend to make errors at the periphery of their knowledge. As it turns out, the edge of your knowledge is day one in complex variables. Please refrain from editing articles on quantum mechanics and mathematics. You clearly do not know what you are talking about.  \"	19205
0	:I did not ignore the hangon notice. I read your explanation and decided that it was not enough to prevent deletion. There are multiple issues with Renegade Rugby as you created it. The most obvious is that it is a clear copyright violation. We cannot ignore copyright violations just because you make a claim that you grant permission. There is no way to know if you are the copyright holder or not. To grant permission we would need the copyright holder to release the work under an appropriate license. The best way to do this would be to tag the original webpage with the license that it is being released under. We obviously can't just accept any editor's word that they are the copyright holder while a clear statement of copyright exists on the original material, if we did anyone could make such a claim for any work and we would not be able to obey the law on copyrights.  :Assuming you are the copyright holder and make the change, we would still require that the text undergo major revision before it could be accepted in a Wikipedia article. In its current state it clearly does not meet our policies on maintaining a neutral point of view and its is not verifiable because it does not have any independent, published sources for the content. I'd recommend you read those two policies before attempting to recreate the article - even after you have resolved the copyright issue. Best,  	19210

On the other hand Wikipedia:No original research states ‘Examples of primary sources include... ...original philosophical works...’ and ‘Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation’ it also states at the end of the paragraph ‘Appropriate sourcing is a complicated issue, and these are general rules. The decision as to whether primary or secondary sources are more suitable on any given occasion is a matter of common sense and good editorial judgment, and should be discussed on article talk pages.’ :::::::The above enables me to derive some conclusions:  :::::::What is mend by “third-party sources” (WP:V) is not exactly the same as “Tertiary sources” (NOR). If the policies do refer to the same they contradict each other, which probably is not the case. I think “third-party sources” are, placed in context, ‘other sources than Wikipedia itself and its editors’; this would make sense, given what follows directly after the line containing “third-party sources”: ‘Reliable sources are necessary [...] to substantiate material within articles...’ :::::::Vassyana said ‘Reliance on Rand directly is a NPOV concern...’ it is now clear that it is of no concern at all. Yes ‘an interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source’ but when the text of the citation speaks for itself no further interpretation is required. She also said ‘there is absolutely no need to rely heavily in any way on the primary material’ which is still argued, in contrast I say there is absolutely no reason not to rely heavily on the primary material. :::::::The arguments pro primary source material have, as of yet, not been given a response; the focus was on the demand to have (mainly) third-party sources. In the proper context primary sources are third-party sources, fulfilling the demand.

0	\"  == Articles for creation/Miriam Battista ==  Hi Arctic Kangaroo,  I'm totally puzzled by the reasons you gave for rejecting this article Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation:/Miriam Battista. Miriam Battista is definitely \"\" 'worthy of notice' – that is, 'significant, interesting, or unusual enough to deserve attention or to be recorded'.\"\" It's true that her moment of national fame was short, but it was intense, and she continued to be noticed in the press as an adult actress. Also, the fact that she received a news obit (not paid for by the family) in the New York Times should in itself attest to her notability, since the obit was published so many years after her heyday. For comparison, please look at the article for Gladys Hulette. I certainly think that Battista rises to at least the same level of notability.  As far as verifiable references are concerned, I truly thought I had over-referenced if anything! There are references to Charles Donald Fox's book Famous Film Folk, Photoplay, Variety, The New Yorker, the New York Times, the Internet Broadway Database, and Internet Movie Database - are these not considered reliable, verifiable sources? If the problem is that I used too many references to privately held materials, I apologize for that, but I thought that the information they included was interesting and enlightening. I guess that raises a basic question for me: would Wikipedia prefer that information from privately held materials be omitted, even if it sheds light on the subject? If the answer is \"\"Yes,\"\" I'm afraid that Wikipedia is missing out on a gold mine of material.  I had been considering trying to get in touch with Wikipedia editors who are working on WikiProject Biography, as well as those involved in WikiProject Film before submitting this article for review, but as a newbie I wasn't sure how to do that. Now that the article has been rejected, I would very much like to get feedback directly from anyone involved in those two projects, as well as more feedback from you. Perhaps you can show me how to connect with those projects.  Thanks in advance for any further light you can shed on your decision and for any help you can give me.   \"	19545

Some orthomolecular proponents claim vindication because the American Heart Association dietary guidelines recommend two servings of fish per week for the general population, and to \"\"consider\"\" fish-oil supplements for patients with coronary disease who cannot obtain one gram of fish-derived omega-3 by dietary means AHA Scientific Statement: Fish Consumption, Fish Oil, Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease, #71-0241 Circulation. 2002;106: 2747-2757.

However, the AHA's official policy statement says \"\"There aren’t sufficient data to suggest that healthy people benefit by taking certain vitamin or mineral supplements in excess of the RDAs,\"\" and does not recommend other supplements, while recommending artificial drugs such as statins, all in contravention to orthomolecular theory.Vitamins and Mineral Supplements-AHA Scientific Position  The AHA does not recommend orthomolecular medicine.http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=10000015&q;=orthomolecular&x;=0&y;=0   \"	19556

0	:::There was much continuity with the earlier English church (Dioceses were reorganised, and new ones created, but much of the senior clergy remained the same, abbeys were dissolved, but some were raised to the status of cathedrals, at Peterborough for instance the last abbot became the first bishop), and under Henry the church retained a largely catholic identity.  It was under Edward that a more Protestant character appeared, due to those who dominated his governemtn (edward was under age).  Of course under Mary the pendulum swung (violently) back the other way, and Elizabeth's position attemoted to reach a compromise.  To some extent that broke down under Charles I, and of course under the Commonwealtha presbyterian polity was adopted, but with the Restoration returned the bishops.  High Church and Low Church had slightly different connotations then, and what we would now recognise as Anglo-Catholicism emerged in the 19th century (along with more evangelical groups such as the Clapham Set).  :::As to Africa, it often depends which missionary society was most active in a given region, and who set up the theological colleges and so on.

In this article I did that recently with the \"\"50 State Quarters Report\"\"  look at footnote 7 here   but after that another editor separated them out again, here.  Also, it's better to link to the reference from the name of the reference being cited, like I did, rather than have the link be a separate unlabelled number like the other editor did.  So, I think the footnotes should be combined again, the way I did it.  Anyone else have an opinion on this? —   \"	19630

I have received a lot of comments from people in my town about the article and a lot of them have told me they learned things that they didn't know before. Recently a user named Bearcat has merged a lot of stub articles into the article about their region. I'm not sure what the policy is on this. Most of the articles were about very unnotible places (mclarens settlement being the best example). But I'm a little unclear on why he seems to insist on merging cobden aswell. The article was over 10,000 words long. I know that there doesn't need to be articles on everything on earth but, and I realize I may be the minority on this, it seems like towns  should have their own articles. I mean.... people may want information about them and it was hard for me to find it all. Now the information is all broken up and scattered across the whitewater region article.   Anyways, the reason I'm bothering you with this is because you seem like you would probably know a little more about wikipolicy than me and I saw you get involved before. I guess you could say I'm asking for your help and opinion. And my main question is this: Are towns not worthy, ever, of their own article?  Ok, thanx  	19819

There, one of his disciples sought to wield a sword of violence to repel the authorities.

This needs editing and NPOV'ing.—    === Copyvio ===  This article was lifted straight from here.    === Grossly Incorrect ===  This article contains gross inaccuracies.  I have added the POV template.  See the discussion under Muslim_Brotherhood#Research_in_Progress.  According to Brynjar Lia's book which I've cited there, neither Banna nor his father studied at Al-Azhar.  According to Lia, Banna was not an admirer of Hitler and strenuously denounced racism as well as the aggressive militarism characteristic of fascism.  According to both Mitchell and Lia, the Brotherhood maintained a policy of avoiding any involvement in World War II.  I've removed these sentences for now, but I will correct this article more thoroughly within the next few weeks.    :Do not delete large portions of the article.Please follow the Wikipedia:Accuracy dispute policy. If you come across content that seems or is inaccurate use the dubios tags.  For entire sections which may be innacurate use disputed tag.     I am restoring the following content which was deleted.   === Education ===  ::* Banna, who had a sizable Islamic library at home, was a graduate of al-Azhar Theological Seminary, a top Muslim seminary. Shaikh noticed Hassan's intelligence and sent him to memorize the Qur'an early in childhood. Hassan memorized the entire Qur'an. He was known for being very articulate as he gave sermons in Mosques at a young age. ::* Four years earlier than his peers, Hassan attended Mosque of Al-Azhar at the age of 16 where he graduated as the first in his class. He refused a scholarship opportunity from The Ministry of Education in Europe.  === ODESSA ===  ::* Hassan al Banna was an admirer of Adolf Hitler and wrote supportive letters to Hitler. Hassan was solicited by Nazi intelligence when Hitler rose to power In the 1930's. He established a Nazi Germany spy network throughout the Arabian Peninsula for Hitler. Al Banna promised Hitler that when Gen. Rommel's panzer division arrived in Cairo and Alexandria, the Muslim Brotherhood would ensure that all of the British troops would be killed.  :::This was removed by an anonymous editor with the claim that it is unproven non-sense. 30 June 2005 02:29 (UTC)  === Coffee Houses Comment === Can anyone verify the comment that Coffee houses were \"\"morally suspect\"\"? I find that difficult to believe. Eqypt had a fairly freewheeling society at the time- something Hassan Al-Banna was against- and one could do much worse than coffee houses.  == Rewrite Using Scholarly Sources ==  I have posted an entirely new text for the Muslim Brotherhood and Hassan al Banna articles, as well as several new articles:  * History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt ** History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (1928-1938) ** History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (1939-1954) ** History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (1954-present) * History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria  This amounts to over 12,000 words of text, and is the result of months of research, discussed in Talk:Muslim_Brotherhood, using reputable scholarly texts found at the library of the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London.  Every paragraph in the main articles is marked with page-number references to the work it is based on.  I am not an expert on this subject, and nothing in these articles is original; I have simply summarised the material in the sources listed.  Some of the sources are more favourable to the Muslim Brotherhood; others are more critical.  By attempting to represent accurately the accounts given in these sources, I hope to have pro	20038

0	\"Dear Mr. Kohl, I was in touch with James Boros at the time of the \"\"Complexity Forum\"\", and he communicated his dissatisfaction with the results in no uncertain terms.  Richard Barrett in a published interview alluded to this affair, believing the rejection of his article was owing to bias.  What is more, practically no major younger figures of the New Complexity were included among the published articles, whereas, for instance, Erik Ulman, who is a very fine composer but not a New Complexity composer, was included. Whatever the reasons for the choice of articles, the failure to include major younger figures associated with the New Complexity seriously skewed this entire \"\"Forum.\"\"  Secondly, I would beg you to not play childish games by removing composers I have posted. You have done fine work on Stockhausen, but you are by no means an expert on the subject of New Complexity. I have not seen a single article of yours focusing on this subject. I have never seen you at any of the festivals in which numerous works of younger composers associated with the New Complexity were performed, such as the bludenzer tage of the 1990's of the Züricher Tage of the early 1990's.  Why would you dare to remove Wolfram Schurig, co-editor of the primary book series focused on the New Complexity, leader of the bludenzer tage in its most daring period, and composer commissioned by leading ensembles throughout Europe?  If you don't know anything about him, this reflects badly on your claim to be an expert in this field.  Why would you remove Klaus K. Hübler, whose influence on New Complexity composers is clearly stated in multiple articles in the New Music and Aesthetics in the 21st Century series. Marc André has received numerous prestigious awards and commissions, and his work has also been closely associated with New Complexity; one need only read his articles appearing in the New Music and Aesthetics series to find support for this assertion.  I would strongly suggest that you do your homework in this field before you go about arbitrarily altering the contributions of others.  You could begin by going through the first six volumes of the New Music and Aesthetics series, then read numerous articles in Musik & Âsthetik (several references that appeared earlier in this entry have been removed) and works by Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf and others.  Then visit several dozen festival in Europe over an extended period. Then do some score study, perhaps beginning with the composers whose names you have removed.  \"	20394

This has been done under section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement.

You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.  If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement \"\"I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later.\"\" You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here.   If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or \"\"db\"\" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

0	\"  Thank you.  I've posted an Associated Press article that appeared on the news wires today, on the discussion page for nitrites.  The article validates my concerns about Wikipedia. I imagine you'll edit it out, or delete it.  I suspect that the general public 'gets it' about Wikipedia, too.  It's regrettable that the folks who are the most knowledgeable about, and best able to use, the intracacies of Wikipedia's rules and regulations are also the people best equipted to use that knowlege to stifle newbies, and/or those who are less computer-savvy, who may make mistakes, or who haven't even yet heard about what a 'sock puppet' is, or RR32 rule, or whatever rules you and heah used to stifle my contributons.  I doubt you'll 'get it', nor do I care.  But, at the end of the day, just maybe   there's a chance that you'll actually understand the damage you do by your holier-than-thou attitudes, and arrogant computer-geek power-plays.  This is in no way meant to be a personal attack\"\" on you or heah, or anyone else who edits in Wikipedia. It's simply the reaction of an ordinary guy, based on his observations and experiences after being stifled by those who dissagreed with his edits. You and heah, in addition to not agreeing with my edits, clearly have the superiour knowledge of how Wikipedia works, which made it easy for you to throw  down obstables to my postings, make false allegations of wrong doing, and activate Wikipedia's rules to either threaten to ban me or block me, or  as you did, to actually ban or block me.   But the more important issue  and problem  is for Wikipedia itself; namely, that this kind of censorship is akin to the autoritarion rulers whose people are only allowed to see or read whatever the rulers deem suitable  which will, as I've said before, only serve to further diminish the already tarnished reputaton of Wikipedia.   \"	20502

0	(So if a king born as an Eastern Chalukya prince became the King of Cholas and was a person of character enough to name himself Chola not Chalukya which practice was followed by his succeeding kings which is borne out by not a single inscription or reference of Kings after Kulothunga I among Cholas named himself a Chalukya or Chola or even Chola Chalukya.  By the same token, Veera Ballala II was son in law or father in law of Kulothunga III, then why were the Hoysala kings after him not called as Chola Hoysalas or Hoysala Cholas... or even as admitted by you in the Chalukya page, Vikramaditya VI was son in law of Veera Rajendra then why were his successors not called Chola Chalukyas or Chalukya Cholas.  Going by the same analogy, not a single Chalukya king after Vikramaditya VI deserved to be called only Chalukya or Western Chalukya, but only Chalukya Cholas.  May I again remind you that not a single friend of adversary of any king from Kulothunga Chola I has called Kulothunga I and his successors as a Chalukya Chola but only Chola or by their epithets like Tribhuvana Chakravartin etc. etc.)  	20537

I disagree that adding bullets or some other form of break/delineation indicates a difficulty in reading a paragraph.  It was something I often saw used in printed encyclopedias a couple decades back, depending on the flow of information and details.     However, to maintain the paragraph format and avoid lists, I feel the material will need to be overhauled.  As it currently reads (which may well be the problem), some delineation felt necessary.  Thus, I think the entry in question could do with a revision so that the production notes/character notes are completely separate from the actor/character list.  Just my two cents.     	20597

Since you can't get on even after a factory reset, you could try modifyin your router DHCP settings so that the subnet it's assigning everything to includes the static IP you assigned for the extender (and if that still doesn't work, the factory default).  Assuming the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0, then this just means the first 3 sections of the IP need to be the same.   	20650

0	\"  == Narciso Yepes's Revolutionary Technical Developments ==  This is a story that has been recounted numerous times by Yepes and by his students: \"\"You know, the guitar is a very unusual instrument, for it seems that in every city of the world there is a great genius of the guitar, someone who knows every single thing there is to know about the guitar, someone who's genius is so great that he or she can learn nothing from anyone else. However, I have never felt that way about myself. When I was around 15, I could play virtually everything written for the guitar, but I knew I needed a teacher, so I went to see a composer and music teacher by the name of Vicente Ascencio, a very famous man in Spain. The first thing he asked me to play was a \"\"musical scale.\"\" I played a standard guitar scale using alternating \"\"i\"\" and \"\"m\"\" fingers, and I played it about as well as any guitarist I had ever heard. Ascencio told me that my scale was not acceptable. He played a scale on the piano, which was much faster than any guitarist could play a scale. Then, he picked up a violin, and played a scale much faster than I could play. He showed me a \"\"musical scale\"\" on several other orchestral instruments, and told me that this is how he expected me to play a scale if I was to be a musician. I tried again to match his accepted norm for scales, but I could not do so. I then told him that this could not be done on the guitar, and, in fact, no one at the time could play guitar scales at the tempos Ascensio and others were using on standard classical instruments. He told me, \"\"Too bad, but if you want to study music with me, you must give up the guitar. I expect you to be able to execute scales at the tempos that have long been the norm.\"\" Well, I had two choices. One was to be the \"\"genuis of the guitar,\"\" to get mad and storm out the door. The other choice was to swallow my pride and to accept Ascencio as my teacher, where I would be obligated to perform at the level of his other students. Fortunately, I chose to stay and learn, for \"\"the door was open\"\" for Ascencio to be my teacher, and I chose to swallow my pride and study with him, and THIS DECISION HAS MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. I went home, thought about scales, and realized that no pianist could play such rapid scales when using only two fingers on the right hand. I started using three fingers instead (ami, mia, iam), and the next week, I was able to play a \"\"musical scale.\"\" He smiled, and told me that I did not have to give up the guitar after all. Then, he asked me for a chromatic scale in 3rds, and, again, the technique used for classical guitar at that time could not execute what other instrumentalists were doing. By the next week, I had figured out a way to play 3rds at the accepted tempo. Thus we went, week after week, and I continued to solve the difficulties to his satisfaction. Eventually, I had developed a revolutionary technique for the guitar. As a result of the experience, I have come to understand one thing:  The minute a guitarist decides he or she is a genius, and pridefully refuses to enter when the door is open to a qualified teacher, is the minute when that guitarist has brought his or her art to a dead end.\"\"   You may also wish to look up Yepes's three-fingered scales/trills techniques  (www.blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID;=145762269&blogID;=376067508 ). Most guitarists are clueless as to the mechanical/technical theory of this (they think it is just repeating a m i over and over again). But it goes with a mechanical theory that is ingenius and (as all great ideas) so simple and logical, it is amazing that no guitarist in the hundreds of years before Yepes ever realized this theory. And that is just one of the many new techniques Yepes invented.   You may add your \"\"citation needed\"\" comments to call this into question, but it will not take away the facts of Yepes's achievements.\"	20847

When I find them I will put them in. But for now as reprinted in my book Super Cosmos p. 25 on Amazon My discovery of the recently observed SUPERSOLID was published in PHYSICS LETTERS Vol 30A, No 5 3 Nov 1969 months before Nobel Prize Tony Leggett published his similar prediction. The title of my paper is \"\"DESTRUCTION OF SUPERFLOW IN UNSATURATED 4He FILMS AND THE PREDICTION OF A NEW CRYSTALLINE PHASE OF 4He WITH BOSE-EINSTEIN CONDENSATION.  Pages 23 -26 have quotes from real BIG SHOT physicists about my work that someone vandalized because it refuted their libel or slander and smears that I am merely a \"\"kook\"\" and a \"\"crank\"\" and a \"\"crackpot\"\" - these are not personal attacks? Huh?  \"\"Dear Jack: Congratulations! What greater pleasure can a physicist have than see a long range prediction finally come true. David\"\" David Finkelstein on March 26, 2005.  Finkelstein emeritus from Georgia Tech  Also on Feb 16, 2005  \"\"Jack, Your solid He4 superfluid paper is wonderful! You actually did something once of very great importance - and apparently you did not realize this. This paper is a precursor to quantum gravity, and much more important in that regard than string theory (you can quote me). George\"\" George Chapline, Jr Ed Teller's Golden Boy at Lawrence Livermore for many years, PhD in physics from Cal Tech.  \"\"To whom it may concern, The Glogower Susskind paper of 1963 which introduced phase operators for a quantum oscillator was in direct response to discussions between Glogower, Susskind, and Jack Sarfatti. Sarfatti's contributions were significant. The correct attribution should be to the 'Glogower, Sarfatti, Susskind' operators. Sincerely, Leonard Susskind\"\" Professor of Physics, Stanford University written on Dec 31, 2004  All three of these reports were vandalized off the article on me and replaced with a false claim from I think Chris Hillman that my co-worker Alexander Burinski in Moscow said that my formula  B(curved spacetime tetrad) = (hG/c^3)^1/2'd'(Goldstone Phase of Higgs Field)  was nonsense. Burinski refuted that false allegation allegedly made by Chris Hillman? Instead they let smears by alt.Kooks and other unqualified people stand in a prominent place and erased the above remarks by important physicists! Now that' the truth.  Now as to my Goldstone paper with Stoneham later head of Theoretical Physics, United Kingdom Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Harwell, Didcot, Berks (see photo in my autobiography \"\"Destiny Matrix\"\" on Amazon. The American Institute of Physics in 1980 or so published a Resource Letter on Symmetry in Physics citing that paper as noteworthy.  You can ask Ray Chiao at Berkeley Physics Dept on how my laser filament paper influenced his early experiments. You can ask Creon Levit at NASA AMES about out oft-cited paper on applying Bohm's quantum potential to molecular structure computer simulations.  Nobel Prize physcist Brian Josephson has been similarly smeared like me because of his interest in the paranormal and cold fusion. Even John Wheeler has been smeared because he uses literate language and metaphor that rankles the hacks who can barely formulate a sentence and hide behind unreadable jargon. To say I use jargon is Pot calling Kettle Black. I am a much clearer writer than most.  Finally my paper explaining the universal slope of the Regge trajectories of the hadronic resonances as tiny Kerr black holes with strong short-range gravity G* ~ 10^40G on 1 fermi scale was published by Herbert Frohlich in 1973 in his journal \"\"Collective Phenomena\"\". It caused Abdus Salam (Nobel Prize) to invite me to ICTP in Trieste, Italy 1973-74. You can ask historian of physics Jagdish Mehra about that. He was there. BTW I was tutored in group theory at Cornell by Robert Brout who I later met again in Brussels in 1973 when I visited Prigogine. Yuval Neeman and others in Israel are working still on this idea connecting QCD to strong short-range gravity. You can also ask Eshel Ben-Jacob head of the Israel Physical Society about me. No, Wikis for shame, for shame! This has been a vicious smear against me perhaps politically motivated because of my national security work. I do not know, but others may well find out. Also my adventures in the weird - paranormal, UFOs have been part of a long-standing covert intelligence operation involving American, British, French, Israeli and other Intelligence organizations. Some of this is explained in all three of my books since 2002 all on Amazon. To focus on my early adventures as a young man 	21097

Intellectually, I am actually rather satisfied to leave it at that.  But - Not!!!!!!!!! For one thing, I enjoy intellectual duelling much too much. All Hail Wikipedia! Ah, for the days of learning for the sake of learning!  I raised the question as part of my pursuit here: why LaVey? Why not Timothy McVeigh? Again, there's not enough room for everyone, so how were the selected selected? We know who is included. Who was excluded, or perhaps simply \"\"non-included,\"\" i.e; unintentionally, in contradistinction to intentional exclusion?????!!  What is more, in view of the evolution of terrorism – to all intents and purposes –  virtually morphing  into a veritable weltanschauung, Timothy McVeigh takes on a new urgency, relevance and intellectual/philosophical challenge.  My fear is that the whole effort is loaded, biased, in violation of Wikipedia rules. The whole thing seems to be a charade to ride satanism in on the ratiocinative coattails of Objectivist Ayn Rand. Otherwise, again, why not Timothy McVeigh? Again, he explicitly mentioned, and is often discussed in terms of Randian libertarianism. She would disown him like a Bolshevik, of course, but then she would disown LaVey in utter disgust!!!! So, if there's room only for one of the two, why LaVey?  If I don't receive reasoned responses, I will edit LaVey out again. Again, boys and girls, my emphasis is on a truly Wikipedian neutral POV.

0	\"==Correct and True Etymology of English words \"\"Myth, Mythology\"\"== Greek μυθολογια \"\"legend, storytelling\"\" is derived from μυθος \"\"speech, thought, story, myth\"\", itself of unknown origin. English mythology is in use since the 15th century, in the meaning \"\"an exposition of myths\"\". The current meaning of \"\"body of myths\"\" itself dates to 1781 (OED). The adjective mythical dates to 1678; English use of myth is later, first attested in 1830, in its original English meaning of \"\"untrue story\"\":  :\"\"These two stories are very good illustrations of the origin of myths, by means of which, even the most natural sentiment is traced to its cause in the circumstances of fabulous history.\"\" Westminster Review 12:44 (1830)  :::This is the earliest known usage of \"\"myth\"\" in English. In case anyone didn't know, in 1830 English \"\"fabulous\"\" doesn't mean \"\"wonderfully aesthetic\"\", it is the adjectival form of \"\"fable\"\", that is referring to a fantasy or fairytale.  In 1830 the term \"\"myth\"\" was new, so it carries what we call a gloss, things \"\"by means of which even the most natural sentiment is traced to its cause in the circumstances of fabulous (i.e., fictional) history.\"\".  This was not only the original use of the word, but the original academic use of the word, note the source, Westminster Review. That is still the way most all people define \"\"myth\"\" today.  It's for reasons like this, that Wikipedia is so notorious for its mental disconnect with mainstream thought, and its enforced use of its own internal terminology / jargon, or to put it less nicely, doublespeak.     In 2005, a single-purpose account added \"\"mythology categories\"\" to a wide range of articles including Death and Resurrection of Jesus, Virgin Birth, and Transubstantiation, creating a huge uproar.  The outcome of the discussions then was overwhelmingly to reject the categories as imflammatory and inappropriate.  It was agreed at that time that theological and scriptural articles do not fall into the category of \"\"mythology\"\" and today, none of these articles are so categorised, apart from Noah's Ark.    Just last month, WP:RELIGION undertook to move the article \"\"Yoruba mythology\"\" to Yoruba religion.  This is because the term \"\"mythology\"\" is held to be demeaning, because Yoruba religion is still practised today, and the Yoruba who practice it constitute a significant viewpoint.    It is indeed regrettable that so much resistance is facing the prospect of extending the same consideration to the canonical Book of Genesis.  The Churches have drawn the line by indicating which books they consider canonical, inspired texts.  Genesis is among them with no exceptions as far as I know. What gives Wikipedia the right to draw the line so as to exclude other Biblical Books from \"\"mythology\"\", but include the stories of Genesis?  No books that are considered sacred scripture by ANY large religion of today should be portrayed as \"\"mythology\"\".  That's simple common sense.  We shouldn't call the Quran \"\"mythology\"\" either, we shouldn't call anyone's sacred books widely adhered to today \"\"mythology\"\".       :Now things like Hesiod and Orpheus are another story, I think the reason Hesiod and Orpheus have conventionally been referred to as \"\"mythology\"\" for some time is because no significant numbers of people have ever come forward claiming to believe these books to be historical or literally true since the year 400.  At least I will go out on a limb and say I don't know of any, not a single one. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's pretty safe to say they have been discarded, and nobody objects to the conventional use of \"\"mythology\"\" for these.  But please realize that this is not the case with Christian, Muslim or Bahai writings, nor indeed the writings of many other living religions.     \"	21668

0	\"  == Note ==  The current lead implies Israeli aggression against Hamas by stating that Israel killed several Hamas members in Khan Yunis on July 6, and Hamas retaliated with rockets. I have been trying to seek consensus for including the Israeli claim that Hamas started firing rockets circa June 30 at DRN. However, it may also be worth noting that Israel maintains the Hamas members killed in Khan Yunis accidentally blew themselves up in one of their tunnels: \"\"Hamas has vowed revenge for what it saw as Israel's deadliest attacks in which six Palestinian militants died, though Israel denied any involvement...The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted \"\"terror sites and concealed rocket launchers\"\" in the enclave, but had not hit the southern Gaza area of Rafah, on the Egyptian border, where the Hamas gunmen died. Military spokesman Lerner said the militants had died when explosives went off in a tunnel that Israel had bombed several days ago, fearing gunmen planned to use it to try and penetrate into Israel.\"\" It turns out the same account was given by The New York Times: \"\"When Hamas militants entered the damaged tunnel a day or so later, they apparently set off explosives there...Hamas blamed Israel, escalating the hostilities that grew into the current confrontation.\"\" Hamas' claim that seven of its members were killed by an Israeli airstrike is not an assertion Wikipedia should parrot uncritically.  \"	21749

0	::::No problem, didn't want to move this conversation as I figured it would be wierd ) Well, first of all, if we look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:The_Scream.jpg, and The Madonna etc, we see that several of these old pictures are in so-called public domain in The USA. And this being the American version of Wikipedia I would think that this link could be added as well. I noticed that the link-page which is on the Norwegian version of this Edvard Munch website, isn't in the English version, and this page cites books and websites as the sources of both images and text. Now, I can see that one may hesitate to link to a website like this, but if one were to deny every similar website (in other subjects/articles) to be linked to when the content is of such importance as it is here, Wikipedia wouldn't be much to look at -) You can find - probably thousands - of links of the same kind in all kinds of subjects and articles on Wikipedia. But as I said, I don't want to start an argument about this, I just think it's interesting to look into a case like this. What can and what can't be linked to... It's no big deal for me personally, but Wikipedia should set a standard and stick to it 100 percent. I just feel that the public should be able to see some other artworks of Edvard Munch than just The Scream and The Madonna...

The heading currently reads \"\"Better Sample of the Groups We Target (For Wikipedia).\"\" This strikes me as problematic. At the very least, it gives the appearance of Wikipedia coordinating with JIDF to promote JIDF, or cooperating with JIDF's self-promotion. (From what I can tell, our image is downloaded from the blog image by Einsteindonut 8-22-08.) I'm sorry if you've already come to consensus about the inclusion of the image in the article, but I did want to mention this interesting nuance. Best wishes,  |   :I don't like the way the JIDF is manipulating this article, posting messages for Wikipedia that are then being used as sources. I wish there was some way to put an end to it, but I think a blog is a WP:RS for what it says about the organization that sponsors it. — Malik Shabazz (talk · contribs)   :: Hm. That's interesting.  The JIDF is only marginally notable (only two major press citations have been found), and being in Wikipedia increases the visibility of the organization. Wikipedia usually doesn't display web site screen shots. Usually an article gets a logo, if that. Also, we have a third-party cartoon in that image without copyright clearance.  Maybe we should drop that image.        :::It looks like the JIDF doesn't want to be on Wikipedia after all. — Malik Shabazz (talk · contribs)  ::::At this juncture, Malik, their opinion about whether to be on Wikipedia strikes me as irrelevant. (I'm assuming that WP:BLP does not apply to organizations, right?) However, if the screenshot is unusual for an article of this size, then I'd be interested in hearing the pro's and con's for keeping the image. (Aside from the promotional concern I've floated above.) Tx,  |    :::::I think there may be copyright problems, because (for example) the Hamas logo is subject to copyright. I've brought the question up at Wikipedia:Copyright problems. — Malik Shabazz (talk · contribs)   ::::::The Anti-Defamation League, AIPAC, and CAMERA Wikipedia pages don't have screenshots. They don't even have pictures other than the logo, and those are organizations with physical offices, known officers, and big real-world events.  The page for Facebook has a picture of Facebook HQ (although, amusingly, that picture is actually of the Japanese restaurant that occupies the ground floor) and a screen shot of the home/login page.  Miniclip has a screen shot of their huge home page in their info box. LinkedIn just has a logo.  Myspace has a logo and a picture of the headquarters building. None of these Wikipedia pages have screenshots of interior web site pages. Wikipedia doesn't usually do that.     :::::::But John, this image serves a different function. It displays the Facebook groups that were the target of JIDF activities. So it seems directly related to the notable aspect of the group's activity. Is it relevant that the screenshot is taken from the JIDF Facebook page or blog sites? After all, it could as well be an independent screenshot of the targeted group, without JIDF as the source. See what I mean?  |    Just to clarify, there was already a sample up.  I read the blog and they made a point saying that the original sample only showed anti-semitic groups and not the terrorist groups, and I wanted to learn how to add an image, so I replaced it.

I noticed your rewrite and you did some good work (and a lot it too) and thanks for that: plenty of review references also.  Although I actually prefer the original but this is probably a matter of style and preference. The good side is that now the original is defunct and no longer published at Wikipedia I can effectively take it back at least by fact although I know not really by law.  I am going to move on from Wikipedia into my own blog... Things have a habit of getting dumbed down here particularly into mediocre and ineloquent English. It is a bit cookbookish now: section by section of the Author's book... Also I don't actually like the Background paragraph style as this should go into the Author Bio page otherwise you would have repeat it for ever Article for every book by that Author!? Hence the downside of a cookbook or templated approach.  Question: are foootnoted references to say comparison with other Authors considered original Research? Also I couldnt find your original ref online but Martin Scoresse does not appear on Cinemaginaire's page for the film as an executive producer - given his preemminence I would pretty much take this as indicating that he is no longer associated with the project? Also although you keenly summarized/precis some of the quotes (particular the first intro one) there were a few bits (perhaps cut down) I would still like to see in the article particularly from his concluding remarks \"\"an ice age hunter gather, clever but seldom wise\"\" etc and the last Easter islander bit as they are muost poignant and expressive rendered thus in the authors own words than in a cookbook summary of the book.  (I had this same difficulty once summarizing Nietzsche for an essay and in the end largely used the authors own words: how can one after all precis Nietzsche!) Please don't be offended.  Maybe we should collaborate a little as I have no doubt that we will get a better result than either of us would otherwise on our own.  Respond here or at my User Mattjs discussion page. (I rarely log in any more but will do so to check.) I will check back here in a few weeks or so (maybe longer) and make a few changes above after your feedback. Regards    (Now i'm off to print and save an older copy for the Article for myself ;-))\"	21950

If you have not created the image yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.  If the image also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture then you can use  to release it under the GFDL.

A comment about the consensus at the GA review would be very handy, and I am more than happy to accept it.  Incidentally I've raised the subject at Wikipedia Talk:Manual of style (dates and numbers) as it seems to me that all it says is to put fractions in \"\"fractional form\"\" without defining what that is, and even in the section WP:MOSNUM#Fractions only says what to do about common fractions, which leaves us high and dry dealing with other fractions – for myself I would not regard  as a common fraction, for example.

Your lack on the basics tells on you.  Besides, there are other ways of personal attacks, aside the insults. Saying such lies is one, unnecesary adjetives to describe my prose (which I admit, for the 100th time, is not that good) is other. Even what I'm doing right know could be considered as one PA, if you are too strict. The only personal atack, if you will, was when I did the critisism on the incomplete intro, although I wasn't directly talking about you and I didn't call you moron or something like you like to call me on the summaries or public disscusion pages like this one. When I called you cynical, it wasn't an insult either, because you seem shameless to tell such lies as you did just above this words.

Jensen have disputed Dickens's and Flynn's findings, calculating a mean gain for Blacks of zero to 3.44 IQ points, and questioned the exclusion of four independent tests that showed low or negative IQ gains.[33] However, in the very same 2006 study that was criticized by Rushton and Jensen, Flynn and Dickens give explicit reasons for why four tests were excluded. Rushton and Jensen include in test such as the AFQT which is not strictly an IQ tests and their inclusion of Herrnstein and Murray's AFQT data was criticized by Flynn and Dickens. Rushton and Jensen derive the figure of a 3.44 IQ point gain by adding data from four excludes tests to Table A1 while Flynn and Dickens' figure of a 5.5 IQ gain for black Americans was derived from Figure 3 in the study.[34]\"\" :1.

lol good luck with that you're not getting that out of me...i mean i'm willing to compromise and discuss things but you are putting half-assed edits..i'm filling them out an expanding and putting sources on them i might add and you or others with your limited mentality revert an article to 1 with very little information ..how are empty spaces better than filled ones? that makes absolutely no sense...i even provide some sources from where i get my stuff from and still complain n harass?...you prob didn't even notice some of the edits there you see in even your edits and others  were done by ME lol, you just built upon it and added your own, i'm not saying you nor others taking credit for others work and research (i hope not that's just unprofessional and messed up) but you got something of a personal motive that you're not admitting to, if i'm doing the edits as best as i can and doing it the same way as you are and tryign to provide sources...what s the problem then? the stuff i get my info from are from credited  1st or 3rd party websites lol..what more do you need? the signatures of the editors of the other websites where i get my info from? come on now haha..why don't you be a little more honest and say what really is your problem with me instead of making escuses for it and when people confront you about it or want to speak their mind you back out...oh yeah that's very mature pal just because i don't believe in the same ideals as you ...i mean how can  an admin of such  \"\"REPUTATION\"\" be so naive..i don't get it..you don't like others to express their disapproval or speak their mind about how to improve an article  i mean this is what U r doing \"\"4 + X = 5\"\"..that's ok to you right ..missing information that you won't even bother to look up fully and this isn't a grammar class people make typos all the time big deal deal with it..this isn't a regular article its a talk page. i got my say as much as you do regardless of how long you have being editing here or your position here etc, i have a say as much as you do...if you can't take criticism of your poorly edited works than maybe you shouldn't be editing here in the first place..you have no seniority or control over me whatsoever..no one does as i don't have over you ...all i'm asking is for me do do things right and i'am i give u sources , i flesh out the articles n fill in the blanks ..what more do you want guy?...don't make arrogant excuses about my typos or so called ramblings just because you can't take being told in your face criticism in your work...the point is i COMPLETE the articles..you and others with your mentality don't finish it or bother to do a more thorough look..so don't make excuses for your wrong doings ..so you can't take criticism, you don't like other people's edits that re more complete and informative than yours unless you are the 1 editing them, you make excuses for people speaking their mind when they tell you things in your face that are mostly true but you aren't mature enough to own up to it, you make it personal...so if you or anyone who thinks like you don't think about it or made the effort than its BAD right? lol...who you think you are? god ? lol ....i try to be respectful and i want to be able to edit freely in my own way even though my versions are usually more complete , informative and thorough, i don't make up facts i don't troll or do things with bad intentions here..especially here because i rely in wikipedia  myself when i want to look up something just because you haven't thought it up or made the effort to be more thorough doesn't mean you or your kind with your mindset have to abuse their authority here because they weren't creative enough to come up wit h it themselves..like i said go ahead and make excuses about misspellings and ramblings because you hide under that to mask your own faults wish it was you who done it and thought it up	22996

And now that your lack of RS was due to a search with the diacritic tactic has been exposed as false, because both returned zero results at Google News (what would you expect from an unnotable subject?), you added the search word \"\"location: Philippines\"\" on Razon.

Probably democratic system was most valid for liberty of every single Republic of jugoslav federation and now we could see Jugoslavia united and democratic without wars and we could see italian soldiers in their nation not in Kosovo and Bosnia! * Broz was not benevolent dictator: he was like Lenin or Castro!

Add your website as an external link at the bottom of the article. If readers want to learn more about what is contained on Britannica's 2003 list, then they'll have that option.

I do feel Timothy Usher is a bigot. I do feel that Jews are screwing up the planet (though admittedly Muslims, by far, surpass the Jews in their capacity to destroy things). Look at history. Only recently has it become the norm to like Jews. That only came about after certain countries (eg America) adopted them as the collective dame-in-distress needing shelter and protection. Sort of the precursor to the chihuahua. Before then, Jews were hated in Europe and America alike..And everywhere else. We all know Jews were once banished from most culturally superior European countries. The only reason why Poland took them in was that they had loads of money. Probably the same reason why Washington panders to the now. Point is, alot of people dislike Jews. I'm entitled to, so long as I don't demonstrate that dislike on articles dealing with the topic of Jews. We don't penalize people for not liking things, do we? His Excellency...

Are there some religious/philosophical beliefs you should declare to us as to why it is difficult for you to be neutral here? The Christian Science tenets are tucked nicely in a reference where they will not take up any room.  The reader is coming to this page to learn as much about Christian Science as possible.  The more ideas the reader can gleen about Christian Science beliefs the better, don't you think.  Why not have both?  There is room. The Scientific Statement of Being is present. There is no conflict in having both.  There are 8 very sound sources that say the Tenets are the core beliefs.  This is the place to tell us why you don't want both present. The talk page.

As adherents of Truth, we take the inspired Word of the Bible as our sufficient guide to eternal Life. :::* 2. We acknowledge and adore one supreme and infinite God. We acknowledge His Son, one Christ; the Holy Ghost or divine Comforter; and man in God's image and likeness. :::* 3. We acknowledge God's forgiveness of sin in the destruction of sin and the spiritual understanding that casts out evil as unreal. But the belief in sin is punished so long as the belief lasts. :::* 4. We acknowledge Jesus' atonement as the evi‐ dence of divine, efficacious Love, unfolding man's unity with God through Christ Jesus the Way-shower; and we acknowledge that man is saved through Christ, through Truth, Life, and Love as demonstrated by the Galilean Prophet in healing the sick and overcoming sin and death. :::* 5. We acknowledge that the crucifixion of Jesus and his resurrection served to uplift faith to under‐ stand eternal Life, even the allness of Soul, Spirit, and the nothingness of matter. :::* 6. And we solemnly promise to watch, and pray for that Mind to be in us which was also in Christ Jesus; to do unto others as we would have them do unto us. And to be merciful, just and pure.  	23389

Doc James (talk ·  Hi Doc James,  I am employed by the Acoustic Neuroma Association, the organization that publishes the information booklets used as source material for this entry.  I worked with ANA's CEO and Board of Directors to edit and update the existing Vestibular Schwannoma entry.  Our organization felt that the entry had some incorrect information, but also needed more detail.

Please advise your editors to avoid using special characters, or, at least, to avoid using \"\"escape\"\" codes, in links and anywhere else that copy-paste could result in such a conversion. For this case, the solution is simple: the name of the page shoud be \"\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_cat\"\". The linking page \"\"...Progressive_retinal_atrophy\"\", as coded, violates \"\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page#Links_and_URLs\"\" in the paragraph which begins, \"\"In the URL, all symbols must be among: ...\"\", and the paragraph which follows.\"	23534

0	== Image:Sue'sBrain.jpg ==  Hi! This is a lovely image... I've just got a couple of queries about its source and copyright status. The image doesn't have good sourcing at the moment (as in: did you scan it from a particular book? or upload it from a particular URL?) and if the Field Museum are the copyright-holders, this should probably be made clearer (it's not obvious whether they are merely the host and source of the image, or the copyright holder). In addition, adding some evidence that the image is available under a creative commons license is really pretty important, not because I'm assuming that it isn't and you're wrong in classifying it as such, but because there are loads of images with daft or deceptive copyright statuses uploaded and a requirement of providing some evidence that rights have been released is near essential. Hope this helps - the image is a nice find, and I would hate to see it getting deleted!  	23616

0	\"  :Thanks.   Believe it or not in the real world I think that we think mostly alike on this.   I'm for the societal normalizaion of homosexuality.   I'm not for the nasty tactics used by some folks who feel that way, including branding anybody who feels otherwise as having a phobia.    And such work against themselves.     But in a Wikipedia sense, such opinions are not relevant.  Two definitions of the word exist, and one of them is sky-is-blue obviously controversial. The problem with the article is that, as a part of a POV quest, it pretends that the more controversial \"\"all opposition is phobia\"\" definition is the ONLY definition. That would be just a difference of opinion but the more severe problem there is the nasty tactics used by a certain cadre there against people who do not agree with their quest.  I think that they have set the record for the amount of bogus tactics and bogus accusations used against a fellow editor.  And when I see people using such tactics against people in Wikipedia to further their purposes, I really see red.  :And no I do not think that you are misguided.  I think that the real world you and your thoughts and efforts are right on track and admirable. And in Wikipedia you are a kind and thoughtful editor.  About the worst complaint I could muster is taking real life advocacy a bit too much into Wikipedia and having a bit of a hard time understanding my someone abstract analysis of the structure of the article, which is necessary to present the issues in Wiki-terms.

0	As both Barney The Purple Dinosaur and a close friend of one Daniel Rooke a.k.a Prime Possum I believe that I am aware of the circumstances of this matter to a greater degree than anybody else. I find the claims of Tntnnbltn quite rediculous, why as  respected membembers of society would both prime possum and myself be lying on the before mentioned issue. How can a text on Prime Poussum be biased, excuse me if I'm mistaken but Prime Possum is loved by all and sundry and aside from the paedophilia incedent and that night we had in Vagas(remember the strippers)Prime Possum has a completely clean record. Further to your claims that people in metropoliton areas are unaware of Prime Possum a recent survey undertaken by Elmer Fudd has determined that 69% of people are aware of Prime Possum. This can be read in a favourable light when compared to a survey undertaken by myself which declares 98% of people regard Tntnnbltn as a wanker. How can you declare Daniel Rooke as not notable this is the same young man who has achieved many feats such as kissing yours truely and taking advantage of a mute with a bung eye.	23645

The tribe has stated they had no involvement as a directive of that sovereign government.   I have reviewed all of the materials, and it appears some individuals participated, but they clearly did not have the consent or backing of the Paiute tribe as a whole.

It has every right over its membership and followers, until forbidden so by the Holy See, that the Holy See itself over all the Church had when it did publish the index. ::Though this has been officially denied, I believe the action of H. Em. Bertone against the Da Vinci Code was not far from censuring, and a quite just censuring too according to what one hears about its content (I actually didn't read it, Michael Crichton is better). ::That Nietzsche was not included (I'm not sure about Schopenhauer) has I believe the easy reason that there was no need of clarification that his works are non-Catholic, and so \"\"on the index\"\" by general rule without any need of explicity. Of course theoretically, those books Kant wrote on religion (and that includes the Critic of pure r.) would be implicitly on the index as well because he was not a Catholic, but from the very fact that he did believe in God, the Congregation may have felt the status of his books, from the Catholic point of view, needed further clarification. Also, not every work of Kant was listed. ::As to its importance as of now, I agree (as a layman and non-theologian) that reading some of the books today not only does not lead to ecclesiastic penalties (as should be sure) but also is not sinful in itself, as no longer any disobedience to Church law (likewise, of course, as to Card. Bertone's semi-censuring) but it may be dangerous and thus imprudent, which can be not free from sin. (?)     \"	23895

0	===The Malvern Water cure=== For what it's worth, I concur that the Malvern Water article benefitted from the exercise. To me, the best indicator that ( was acting in good faith on 12 November 2009, with the Talk:Malvern Water#Advertising tag was that it was Jerem43 who removed it following Gyro's efforts. I came to that article late, so wasn't caught up in the earlier argy-bargy (so to speak). But I see that since the efforts surrounding that period, both the article and its discussion page have settled down completely.   There certainly was quite a bit of reference to the Malvern Water article in our discussions. Mostly this was to contrast two referencing styles and layouts. One 'exemplified' by Malvern Water, and one 'exemplified' by Shakespeare. Mind you, the William Penn article might benefit from the latter style (but not necessarily). I counted 74 individual page citations for Hans Fantel's 1974 book - nearly double that of Schoenbaum (1987) in Shakespeare.  The above discussions highlight another thing which the Malvern Water article exemplifies. How one can sometimes find the solution in the problem. The problem being the criticism, and the solution in this case being to take it in good faith, and see what transpires - in this case an improvement. Of course, this might not always be the outcome. But assuming criticism as being in good faith generally raises the chances of a favourable outcome. Not everyone knows how to constructively criticise - we typically learn that through experience, if we're lucky (in my own life, I'd have handled many past situations differently in light of what I now know). And by acting as if the criticism or editing changes are in good faith, if perchance they are maliciously based, that will become so self-evident that it's impossible for any reasonable person to miss. Even then, what may have started out as malicious may resolve favourably if the other editor gets a kind response. A funny old world indeed, what with that and the irony that the Malvern Water cure still seems to be working its magic!   Wotnow	23943

It's now clear, however, that you simply don't appreciate what's happening here, and no matter how hard I try, you never will.  ::I know this will be futile, but I'll explain how I see things one last time: The Humanities RefDesk used to be a wonderful place to learn. OPs would ask questions, and a decent variety of intellectuals would put in their admittedly POV two-cents, with the result of providing the OP with a variety of differing POV answers, which is basically the closest one can get to an NPOV answer to any \"\"humanities\"\" related topic.

One who verbally abuses other editors in the cruelest and most sadistic of manners due to the \"\"folly\"\" she percieves in their contributions (while the admins conveniently turn a blind eye). One who is incapable of those all-too-human facets known as humilty and fallability. This editor proceeds upon handing down, as if from above, her more-often-than-not flawed, revisionist, biased, and downright incorrect responses (and from my own ethnic POV, extremely offensive and insulting to the memory of my family) to historical questions. When these responses are succesfully challenged, she is incapable of responding in a civil manner (not just to me) and lowering herself to \"\"stand corrected\"\".  ::These, to me, are not the makings of a RefDesk editor, nor a proper historian.   ::But once again, you're right.

We've never even spoken on the phone, and interestingly, I know rather little about him except that he's apparently from Detroit and that we disagree on pretty much every issue except for the fact that Clio's a fraud! I'm actually rather curious. I've often wondered if Stu is perhaps some obese Asian guy, some skinny Black guy, some white senior citizen, or whatever!)   If you want to block me, then block me.

0	To the original topic, Kittybrewster, I realize that this is your topic area of greatest interest, but I've been thinking about a good answer, and the best I can come up with is this: we're both wasting time here. It seems at the end of the day, I'm convinced that both you and Vintagekits are to blame for a series of Wikipedia-as-battleground incidents, and you do not. From where I sit however, when he went straight to his old battleground, you welcomed him back in kind - and the fact is on Wiki experienced users are expected to do better than that. Some sort of attempt at peacemaking is best, or some sort of dialogue or somesuch. When you ran straight to an admin and then AN/I to get the topicban reinstated, it showed me that you are not interested (probably because you believe it is impossible) in working together with Vintagekits - and possibly others who share his viewpoint. You see it as more Vintagekits' fault, but from my chair, you're both beyond the cutoff. Please remember, my job is to not create parity, equity, equality, or even justice, though I flatter myself and think I can produce it in my own life on occasion. No, I am an administrator not a philosopher-king, and at the end of the day Wikipedia needs no one, not you, Vintagekits, or I, more than it needs a productive working environment as a whole.  When I was involved with Vintagekits' topic ban, at the previous round with the Baronets and troubles bans, I can tell you that they worked to great effect, maintaining him in a topic of interest - despite his protestations of injustice. I hope you can find something you're interested in as well outside your original main content. Try stretching outwards a little - perhaps the history of the British Parliament as a whole, and our articles on parliamentary procedure need to be updated badly and are Americentric.

0	\"  == objections to example given; ambiguous and false ==   \"\"The probability of taking data more than two standard deviations from the mean is roughly .05. Six measurements were taken, so the probability that one should be so far from the mean is .05*6 = .3\"\"  I have several objections to this statement: the first sentence above is true in the case of data from a normal distribution for which the true mean and true variance are known. In general it is not true. Furthermore, in the example given, the observed (estimated) values of these parameters are used. One can't just replace true values of the parameters with the estimated values and expect whatever probabilistic statement one's trying to make to remain true (and not necessarily even \"\"roughly\"\" true as stated, especially for a sample of size 6).  Furthermore, even IF the data are from a normal distribution and IF one does happen to know the parameters' true values (or good estimates thereof), the probabilistic statement made (the second sentence above) is ambiguous and false: the probability that \"\"one should be so far from the mean\"\" (in the exact sense) is in fact zero, since the normal distribution has no point masses. If the event whose probability is meant to be calculated is \"\"exactly one should be so far or further from the mean\"\", then that value is actually , not 0.3 as claimed. Or, the probability that \"\"at least one should be so far or further from the mean is actually , not 0.3 as claimed.

0	\"  == The argument from majority ==  Fine, this is Wikipedia and not primary literature, so the argument from majority is not automatically considered a logical fallacy. OK.  But how many people have rejected the DC hypothesis for reasons other than \"\"bah, yet another long-range proposal\"\"? (Again, the fact that the Proto-Caucasian and Proto-Sino-Tibetan reconstructions used are difficult to test is in the article – you're welcome to move it to a more prominent position.) Sure, Trask has, mainly because his reconstruction of Pre-Basque is different. (I will mention this more prominently in the article.) But besides?  Here is a post by Stefan Georg on when a hypothesis on language relationships should be considered accepted. For the record, Georg is currently most famous for fighting against the Altaic hypothesis (though he accepts a Tungusic-Korean-Japonic grouping as likely), rejects Nostratic, rejects DC, but accepts Seefloth's Uralo-Siberian because it's based on morphology. Here is a follow-up by Trask, here one by Vovin, and here another one by Georg.  To be an Indo-Europeanist, you have to know a lot about each of the branches of IE. How many people, other than the late Starostin, have anything near that kind of knowledge about East Caucasian and West Caucasian and Yeniseian and Sino-Tibetan and so on? Bengtson seems to be working on it, but he almost completely limits himself to Basque, the two Caucasians, and Burushaski (which he finds to be closely related), but he almost never mentions Sino-Tibetan or Na-Dené. That makes about one half of a person that is capable of judging the DC hypothesis (as a whole) beyond finding mistakes in the data from one of the supposed members. For that matter, Starostin himself largely ignored Na-Dené, Basque, and Burushaski.  Is there (already) a paper that takes the proposed evidence apart? If so, I'll be glad to cite it. (For the record, here is a discussion of a paper that shows, IMHO quite clearly, that what little evidence there was for including Omotic in Afro-Asiatic was wrong. A link to that paper is included.)  Here, incidentally, is an introduction to Burushaski – secondary literature – which makes favorable comparisons to Yeniseian and Sino-Tibetan.  In sum, I don't see anything wrong with presenting the hypothesis (in its latest incarnation) on Wikipedia. It is a controversial discussion subject, so (comparatively) many people will find it interesting.  In the meantime, I'll add some morphological evidence (suppletive pronoun paradigms, noun class prefixes) to the Macro-Caucasian section of the article, provided that Bengtson tells me that this paper is actually published. I'll also try to make more mention of the hypotheses that combine Sino-Tibetan with geographically adjacent families and thus contradict DC.  \"	24291

0	\"  == Citation analysis consistent with the critique of the IP editor ==  I have no longstanding or longterm interest in contributing to the quality of the article, but have a strong interest in seeing broad, general improvements in the sourcing of scientific articles—including those in the common space between social and biological sciences. And I have an interest in seeing IP editors treated well, by the majority of us, not the few.  The recent visiting IP editor was so set upon by more experienced editors that I thought I would perform a first-pass (rough draft) evaluation of this article, strictly from the perspective of evaluating its sources.  The goals in doing this are three: *(1) To allow us to come to consensus as to the quality of the article, at least in terms of verifiable information (though for this scientist, and for purists such as myself and NeilN, it is likely that if sources should come out, content must also); *(2) To identify patterns of problems, so particular individuals with time and desire might address them (e.g., incomplete therefore unverifiable entries, poor specific sources for particular blocks of information, varyingly formatted similar sources and repeat sources making source followup difficult, etc.), and  *(3) To create a list of first issues to address, so that there might be a common set of priorities (i.e., where the list below might, in months to come, be sprinkled with  markers).  In doing this, I am applying the same academic standards as I might have in reviewing a paper submission from a sixth form or older student, on into university. This is the sort of thing that, while scholarly (so we might each might differ on the details of the analysis), all might agree to the trends represented (and all might have arrived at the same perception within minutes reviewing the article references, and have accomplished a full first-pass evaluation in an hour or so.) That is, we can see for ourselves, instead of taking the a priori position that all is fine enough to remain, or insisting a new editor argue her or his case, thoroughly and decisively, to more seasoned Wikipedia hands.  After having done this evaluation, I have come to the conclusion that the article weaknesses referred to by the IP editor appear to be substantiated. From the persecutive of reliability of information, based on expectation of high quality and verifiable secondary sources suited to the content, I conclude that the article is in very poor condition.  After reviewing this summary of the state of this article's sources, see if you might not agree.   Here, in bullet form, are cogent observations from the evaluation of the article's sourcing:  * >70 references to 12 or more undergraduate textbooks as sources, rather than the scholarly secondary or tertiary sources drawn upon by those texts (see more below);  * >70 references to books that appear without page numbers—King 2008 and King 2009 (47 refs), Buss, Crain (5), Boccadoro (2), Fausto-Sterling, Rathus (3), Russon, Farrell, Coon (2), Escoffier, Al-islam.org, Stearns Major Patterns, Stearns Sexuality (6), Greene;  * 47 (36 plus 11) references to the same undergraduate textbook (King, 2008 and 2009), in two entries, all appearing without page numbers;  * More than a half dozen books lacking full citations, particularly, date of publication (e.g., King, Buss, Stearns Major Patterns, Stearns Sexuality), but also, other obscured details (e.g., David Weeks, Secrets of the Superyoung. Berkley., is actually D, Weeks & J. James, 1999, Secrets of the superyoung: The scientific reasons some people look ten years younger than they really are and how you can, too\"\", New York:Villard Books, etc.)  * Long articles (> 20 pp) without narrowing part of article sourced via Section name or page number (e.g., Ross, Freud, Nagel, Lee et al, CDC);  * Nonsense page references (e.g., Kim & Ward);  * Many bare URLs or URL-only citations without links (find articles.com, enotes.com, TheAge.com.au, etc.);  * Multiple (>8) references to dead links (facts.org, psychnews.psychiatryonline.org, eehow.com, etc.);  * Many egregiously inappropriate web-based sources, including innerbody.com, about.com, essortment.com, howstuffworks.com (!), proplusmedical.com (male enhancement sales page!), eehow.com, TheAge.com.au, etc.;  * Many further web-based sources for which there are clearly better scholarly sources available — see appearances of Csongradi, oxytocin, innerbody.com, about.com, essortment.com (e.g., on Skinner), CNN.com and HuffPost (on G-spot validity), howstuffworks.com, proplusmedical.com, cwluherstory.org (as source of Anne Koedt article), jrank.org, eehow.com, TheAge.com.au, pop religious web pages for seriou	24334

I have changed it back to 604.9 metres as no official statment has yet been made by Emaar.  I propose that the height not be changed unless Emaar makes an official statement or there is a change of the height on the Burj Dubai's official site: www.burjdubai.com.  Since only the developer knows the exact height, we should not use any updates or information from other sources.  Once the height on the official website is updated should we change the height here on Wikipedia.    |   :I agree.  One official source is better than many conflicting unofficial sources.      == Remaining milestones == I have my doubts whether the Petronius oil platform qualifies as a \"\"world's tallest freestanding structure\"\" and as a milestone for Burj Dubai to pass.  Most of it's structure is below water and therefore doesn't qualify under CTBUH rules.     :I do not have an opinion on the issue, just a few comments.  Consensus is that it is not considered the tallest; and therefore may not warrant being included as a milestone.  But, despite that, it does stand taller than the CN Tower, even if it is in water.  It will not hurt if we keep it, and will not be a major deal if we take it away.  Let us see if anyone else has an opinion.    |    :: At this rate, we gotta keep all those deep level mines too since they are much 'taller' than any tower or oil platform ever built.     ::Actually, many argue that the Petronius is the \"\"tallest free-standing structure\"\", hence the usual addition of \"\"on land\"\" to the Burj Dubai's title (for now), and previously to the CN Tower's title. So I don't agree that consensus agrees to the contrary; consensus agrees that it is not on land, but there is much support of it being a free-standing structure in general. CTBUH has never released any information about the world's tallest structures; it only measures the height of the tallest buildings, so by its rules the CN Tower also would not count. It is therefore not very relevant in this situation. Anyway, I believe that the Petronius should be kept as a milestone. Cheers, -   :::Would Petronius stand on it's own without buoyancy?    :::: Even if it can, a lot of the difficulty of a tall structure is in the construction process.  Oil rigs have a serious advantage there because they don't need tall cranes, because you can access the top with boats.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by      == Bill Baker == Some mention should be made of Bill Baker the head structural engineer at Skidmore	24784

0	\"  ==Rankings== At the beginning of October, substantial material was added which is mostly critical of the University's recent performance and advertising. With a few tweaks, this material has mostly been accepted on Wikipedia. However, the section on rankings has since then been subject to a slow edit war between the original anon and another. I reproduce the fuller version of the section below for discussion: :In 2010 QS World University Rankings ranked the University of Canterbury 189th overall in the world, making it the third highest ranked university in New Zealand. Its individual global subject rankings were: 212th in Arts & Humanities, 110th in Engineering & IT, 242nd in Natural Sciences, and 152nd in Social Sciences. In 2011 the University of Canterbury slipped from 189th to 212th in these rankings.http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/5569146/NZ-universities-lose-ground University loses ground. As the 2011 results were released, the University of Canterbury launched an advertising campaign in which the VIce Chancellor Dr Rod Carr claims that it ranks among the top 2% of universities in the world but without elaborating on what basis this was assessed.http://www.bsec.canterbury.ac.nz/ Uni in top 2%. Further, the University has promoted itself as being the first university in New Zealand to have been granted five stars by QS Stars, a global university rating system.http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/5708043/Canterbury-University-gets-top-marks Canterbury University gets top marks. Unlike the QS World University rankings, QS Stars ratings are only given to universities that pay a fee; the programme is designed to give \"\"...those institutions that are not highly ranked or do not appear in the rankings an opportunity to reach out to their prospect students, to stand out and to be recognised for their excellence.http://iu.qs.com/projects-and-services/qs-stars/ QS Stars.\"\" The second anon wishes to truncate the paragraph after the second sentence, ie from \"\"In 2011\"\" onwards. No reason has been given for this. I have suggested that this third sentence remain, since it is purely factual and referenced, but I am less willing to defend the rest of the paragraph which appears to be combining a number of sources to make an argument or inference not directly supported by the sources directly. My proposal is clearly not satisfactory to either of the anons. I welcome their explanations here, and input from other parties.- \"	24982

0	\"== GUSAC-GITAM University Science and Activity Center ==  About GUSAC by G U S A C - Gitam University Science and Activity Centre on Tuesday, August 16, 2011 at 2:54pm · GITAM University Science and Activity Center   The GUSAC team is privileged to invite the students across the GITAM University. After several untiring efforts we have been finally successful in launching a Science and Activity Center at GITAM University.     MOTTO:     “ It’s not what you know, It’s what you do with what you know” .        Our main objective is to integrate knowledge and transfer the same to students.GUSAC will provide an exclusive platform to the \"\"Budding Future\"\" by nourishing their creativity. It will unleash the genius with in them and capacitate them to implement their ideas to the in numerous problems arising in the world.        A fresher aims to attain his/her goals during his/her tenure in the university. GUSAC provides a scope for students like these by imparting knowledge through classes,friendly seminars, practical assignments....., it also enables them to build a team for participating in fests  and assists them with the required infrastructure to make their projects, besides creating a platform for the student research.   Benefits of GUSAC:   It creates an environment for interested students to evenly space out and implement their ideas. Many students who have potential and are interested in participating in various events fail to do the same may be due to lack of proper inter-departmental knowledge and freedom to put forth their ideas. This center fill these gaps and provide better prospects for the students of GU. Students will be exposed to national level competitions and are provided with a platform to put forth their projects and to gain recognition for their work. Most of the projects aimed at will be targeted towards nation-building, to help the needy and the disabled. Seeing the benefits of GUSAC, here is a tentative curriculum on how GUSAC moves forward:   GUSAC will  be administered in the following manner:   Step 1: All the students are free to enroll into GUSAC by giving names into database and will be accessible to weekend classes, friendly seminars and practical assignments. Step 2: The students who are regular to the weekly classes with their active involvement towards GUSAC will be shifted to this step based on a small essay or a video on \"\"why should they be selected into step-2\"\". In step 2 the student is free to access the GUSAC labs and to use the equipments as well. Step 3: Eligible students of second year (sophomores) will be placed in a semi-core group and will contribute to the decision making process of GUSAC. Step 4: Eligible students of third year (juniors) will be placed in sub-core and will have higher powers than semi-core. Step 5: Eligible students of final year (seniors) will be in the core group. They will co-ordinate all the events of GUSAC and will play a crucial role in the decision making process of GUSAC.   The students will be given weekly assignments which will make them think out of the box and students who win will be awarded in an interesting way. The freshers can gain extra knowledge and make use of this to innovate projects using their time productively.     Stepping Stones to Success: A student gathering will take place every week to discuss their interests and recent trends in Management, Science and Technology. Students will work on their projects and ideas with freedom and utilities. Experienced students will give lectures and problem statements will be given to students as practical assignments to keep enhancing their engineering skills. Events like expos, seminars, fests and workshops will be conducted on a regular basis and representatives from the industry as well as academic circles  like IIT’s  will be invited to these events. Faculty members who are interested in sharing their knowledge will always be welcome to do so in any of the aforementioned events and gatherings. Students will be informed about the fests, events, industrial visits, internships to retain the practical approach of curriculum. The center will be visiting schools nearby to have  chalk talks with the kids and also will give them a privilege to showcase their ideas. The interested one's will be called upon to the university to have a look at our projects and ideas.   If the chords of ingenuity have struck right, why not unearth the Einstein with in you???   @ GITAM STUDENTS  why late, get yourself enrolled in GUSAC and  scale heights in the world of emerging trends.\"	25036

0	Hi Rpau23,      I appreciate your comments and I agreed with most of them.  I realized after you mentioned it that I needed to change the wording of one of the sentences under the Career heading.  I think it works a bit better now.  Creating hyperlinks for some key words was beneficial too.  However, in regards to creating a hyperlink for Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever - they are graduate students working with Geoffrey Hinton and do not have Wikipedia pages written on them, so I can't make any links for them.  As for the picture of the Hinton, Wikipedia seemed to give me a hard time for trying to upload a photo unless I had explicit consent from the owner of the photo.  I had contacted Hinton previously to get some information from him personally, but I got the sense that I was annoying him slightly as he said he was really busy and was terse in his responses, so I decided not to pursue him for the picture.  Thanks for your comments and criticisms though - they were helpful.  Angelamarti,      Thanks for your input, it was quite useful.	25096

I wish to redirect all those Hindu nationalist editors on this page to the Indian numerals one because it needs serious work on what should really be its topic. I have made distinction between a numeral system (Hindu-Arabic numerals) and a specific numeral script (Arabic Western, Arabic Eastern, Devanagari, etc). There should be a page for the Hindu-Arabic numerals system that makes mention and links to the various numeral scripts within it, but this Arabic Numerals article should remain to its topic.   .	25126

Our country was founded on the basis of secularism and freedom for all religions, not on some Hindutva ideals. The RSS is tearing this country's existence to pieces by attacking the non-Hindus. And the only reason it is able to do so is because the BJP government does not do anything against it since many of it's members come from that hatred-spewing RSS. And what is Modi doing about it? Nothing. That is because he too is a hate-monger like the RSS. He is a dog! And he should be treated like a dog!   	25206

0	\"Carl_Paladino&diff;=388097440&oldid;=388080941 October 1], and again on October 2. On Linda McMahon, you have a long history of editing and edit warring on the page, and probably would have been blocked if Malinaccier hadn't protected the page on September 17; your October 1 and October 2 edits are inadvisable due to your history on that page, but I'm not really concerned with those since the things you reverted are borderline vandalism. Therefore the main motivation for the current block was your final edit to Carl Paladino.      ♠  ::::::I'm not sure I buy two reverts in two days as disruptive edit warring. Moreover, the combination of low speed and non-explicit warnings are concerning. Certainly, the articles in question attract people writing for differing political agendas, but I'm not aware of any specific sanctions/enforcement which apply to these articles at the moment.    Sir - my \"\"history of edit warring\"\" was basically two years ago.  20 total edits on a page [Linda McMahon]] which another editor has over 800 edits does not seem to me to show anything near an edit war.  So I am surprised to see your rationale is the Carl Paladino page!   is a legitimate edit, and not actionable at all.  is also proper, and a day earlier.  I have a grand total of 28 edits on that page, or an average or just over an edit a day also removing clear vandalism as well).  But you blocked me without any indication of my crime, and were absent for quite a while - leaving me in limbo.  Frankly, 72 hours for a person who has no recent edit war problems seems extreme.   And for this use of block as punishment - I have doubts as to propriety thereof.  Did you block because Ohiostandard kept asserting that I was edit warring?  AFAICT, he never even posted a single diff for his charge. Thank you - now can I be unblocked so I can resume normal editing?  My radiation treatment limits my activities quite a bit.  Oh - look at this sort of \"\"editor\"\" I have had to face at ,  and a favorite example to show the kind of edits I reverted on the article.     ::This looks like a bad block, and even worse when I read the explaination from the admin. Is there any \"\"history/involvement\"\" per say with the blocking admin?    WRT asserting that Ohiostandard 'warned me\"\" - he never edited on the Paladino article, nor mentioned it to me. Right now the block is clearly punitive, and I respectfully request it be removed with a note that it was not \"\"edit war\"\" on my part. I do not see the point in having a clear record for nearly two years - and then being blocked for a 1RR because someone \"\"thinks\"\" I must be watched! The only connection I have with Ohiostandard is that he did not like my post about Screwball23.    Examples of current edits from others  .

Add arrogant Frenchmen into the mix and it makes editing French pages extremely litigious and the same vein as certain brit/american/auz litigations on language use. Some days I think that each language wikipedia needs to invent a country/region specific tool because endless regionalisms in a single intro is heavy. Another source of litigation is overuse of internet references, often these pop culture science sites are rife with distorted or misinformation, for internet references I like to limit it to webpages which are themselves well referenced or science organizations vs virtual non contactable entities (of course, as an overeducated scientist, mostly I mean in context of scientific notions) or media pages (I distrust these most). :Best wishes to you.  \"	25267

The hadith I compiled and found are from the chapter called \"\"Manumission of Slave\"\", while the alleged hadith on manumission discouraged is from a chapter called \"\"Gifts\"\" especially the 16th section titled \"\"A woman giving gifts to someone other than husband\"\"   \"	25448

0	Well, I am not goint to stay, it simply to much of a waste of time, maybe I will check back in in a few years, and I would be happy to provide reading recommendations for anyone who asks me. (It would not be hard to find my real e-mail address using the information about me you already know). But I will take up this last discussion because of your specific invitation.   The Tangut did not speak Chinese, they spoke their own language. The official name of their land in their own language has been written about by Ksenia Kepping and is available on a link from the Tangut Language page. In no case was Xia there autonym. It was something like Minyag which is waht they are called in Tibetan.   In general I have a big chip on my sholder about Sinologists becomming confucian literati. The Yuan, and Qing were no more Chinese than I am. To use Chinese names for these political entities is to take for granted the medieval Chinese worldview. While now it is indeed true that the PRC owns a big chunk of Asia how much of it is actually historically China?  The Jurchen's, Kitans, Tangut, Mongols, Tibetans, Nanchao, Azha (Tüyühün) were their own countries with their own languages and customs. Tangut history is relevant to Chinese history in the way that French history is relevant to English history, but also vice versa.   To have a thing on the article saying 'this article is part of the section Chinese History' reinforces the view that the Tangut's don't deserve their own history.   There is a sociological fact about Western academia that Sinology is big and well funded, while Tangutology, Nanchaology, Kitanology etc. are all virtually nonexistant. But this is a fact about us, and not about the history of Central/East Asia.	25506

Since most non-Jewish residents are concentrated in the eastern part of the city, and the count of 410,000 people refers to the 1948-67 Jordanian municipality borders, that would mean that only about 52% of east Jerusalem is populated by non-Jews, and western Jerusalem is populated only by 280,000 persons.

I don't want to impose too much, but I'm curious: Did you actually read the article that started the altercation between me and Medeis, or did you just look at the links he provided to his own talk page? I fully admit that I was being mildly insulting. I can also assure you that I could have done much \"\"better\"\" at being insulting if I had put the effort into it. Medeis himself has also proven himself capable of insults as you can see by browsing his talk page and then looking up the other side. One particularly inelegant response to somebody who did not agree with him was \"\"Hah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Eh hm. Huh, hah, ha, ha, ha! (Hah!)\"\". But he seems to have developed a habit of threatening all kinds of things, if his own hide is pierced.  He's new, I'll grant that. But if you want to know what the fuss was about, it started right here: Pama–Nyungan languages. He seems to be reverter-in-charge of that page. By his own admission he knows nothing about the subject. Neither do I, as a matter of fact, but there are a couple of things that I am aware of in this field, and one of them is that the current orthodoxy is still in its hypothesis stage.  Take a look if you're interested in Australian languages, but beware of the article's bias - this bias is what started it all.

Truly sad, indeed.    Also, regardless what you want to refer to the chinese as, china is the reason why the US's economy is in the crapper, and why our unemployment rate is higher than it has been since the early 1980's.

It has been said that most people never pick up a book after leaving high school. Proof of this exists in the fact that this word can be taken so blatantly out of definition, that persons are asking that it be banned from the English language. As I said, idiots and words can be a dangerous combination.  What is even sadder is that I expressed this comment on wiki's niggardly page, and was accused of vandalism, yet others posted similar comments.

In fact, there are lots of people who doand they refer to the aforementioned individuals as \"\"vandals\"\".  However, they are never blocked for this.  Since, according to you, \"\"being an asshole to people who disagree with you\"\" is a blockable offense, it follows that one of the following must be true: :#Calling someone a \"\"vandal\"\" does not constitute being an asshole, in which case I should not have been blocked because by calling deletionists (who disagree with me) \"\"vandals\"\", I was not being an asshole to people who disagree with me. :#Your statement that it is unacceptable to be an asshole to people who disagree with me is false, in which case I should not have been blocked because assholery is in fact not unacceptable behavior.  :Or perhaps you meant to say that because someone disagrees with you is not ipso facto sufficient reason to be an asshole to him.  Again, one of the following must be true: :#Calling someone a \"\"vandal\"\" does constitute assholery, in which case one can infer (from the fact that those who refer to the Snoopy types as \"\"vandals\"\" have never been blocked for that) that it is acceptable to engage in this specific type of assholery towards those who are indeed vandalsand, as I proved on , deletionists are indeed vandals (you claimed that my proof was \"\"bullshit\"\" and that it did not need refutation, but your assertion does not make it so) :#Calling someone a \"\"vandal\"\" does NOT constitute assholery, in which case it's all irrelevant since, as I was not being an asshole, the conditions under which being an asshole is acceptable are not an issue. :#Calling someone a \"\"vandal\"\" only constitutes assholery if it is false, in which case see the above-mentioned proof as to why that is not the case here.  Now, which of these alternatives is it?  Alternately, you can show me a fallacy (if I were you, I would try and find a false dichotomyor trichotomy, for that matteras my argument rests on showing you how none of the possible conclusions of your argument justify a block on me; perhaps you will be able to find an alternative I have missed that does indeed justify blocking me) or a mistaken premise and I will gladly concede that my behavior was wrong and was deserving of a block, and will change in the future.   \"	25730

0	\"   ==Arbitration enforcement action appeal by Yossiea~enwiki==  Procedural notes: The rules governing arbitration enforcement appeals are found here. According to the procedures, a \"\"clear, substantial, and active consensus of uninvolved editors\"\" is required to overturn an arbitration enforcement action. To help determine any such consensus, involved editors may make brief statements in separate sections but should not edit the section for discussion among uninvolved editors. Editors are normally considered involved if they are in a current dispute with the sanctioning or sanctioned editor, or have taken part in disputes (if any) related to the contested enforcement action. Administrators having taken administrative actions are not normally considered involved for this reason alone (see WP:UNINVOLVED).  ; Appealing user   –     ; Sanction being appealed  48 hour block for https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:List_of_military_occupations&diff;=690173133&oldid;=690166858  ; Administrator imposing the sanction    ; Notification of that administrator  The appealing editor is asked to notify the administrator who made the enforcement action of this appeal, and then to replace this text with a diff of that notification. The appeal may not be processed otherwise. If a block is appealed, the editor moving the appeal to this board should make the notification.  ===Statement by Yossiea~enwiki===  That was not a personal attack. Don't come in the middle of a discussion just because one person decides to complain, if that happened at all.

0	\"  == This is A Potentially Ridiculous Article ==  Seriously, it is a potentially ridiculous article, and mislead readers to comprehend the word \"\"x86\"\", for the following reasons:  1. Should sort AMD64 or Intel64 implementations as x86? Generally \"\"x86\"\" was used to point all the processors compatible with IA-32 ISA, might or might name themselves with \"\"86\"\", such as Cyrix 5x86, Intel Pentium 4 and so on. AMD64's long mode is devised by AMD rather than Intel, so how can one sort them together. Nowadays software labeled themselves as \"\"x86\"\" are IA-32 compatible software, and use \"\"x64\"\" or \"\"x86-64\"\" differentiating with it. So this article confuses reader getting in touch with this word.   2. Generations? What is the 8th generation x86 processor? Who invented this kinda processors? AMD K8 just says that it succeeds AMD K7 rather than saying it is the 8th x86 processor, and I've never heard Intel call their x86 processors exceeding the 7th generation. And one thing should never be denied, the first generation of Itanium processor says its family model number as 7, which might potentially imply that Itanium might be the 7th x86 processor succeeding Pentium III, but none confirmed this. So take turn back the Transmeta's Crusoe and Efficeon, if the morph firmed on the system board implements x86 decoder call themselves as x86 processors, then if put the same processor on another board implementing PowerPC decoder, then it would be the PowerPC processor? At this situation, what kind of processor is it? Ridiculous! What's more for what sort it as the 7th/8th generation x86? Who is another Jane Austen, making up another Northanger Abbey?  3. \"\"x86\"\" is one architecture(ISA) name? What such a ridiculous thing that I've ever heard on earth! \"\"x86\"\" is used to referring the processor, a kind or series of processors rather than an architecture. If it were the name of an architecture, then in this logic way, Intel 80486 is one of the \"\"implementation\"\" of this \"\"architecture\"\"?   \"	26003

1	Che Guevara was the same as Adolf Hitler, George Bush (not that he ordered the killings of unarmed civilians like Che), Osama Bin Laden, etc. He killed people through orders and infact this man killed people in person while shouting that he was protecting these people and killing them for their own good. Not even Adolf Hitler claimed to be killing people for their own good. He was a communist and a strong beacon on what communists are really like in power, try to prove me wrong? How many communist regimes have resulted in the deaths of thousands? Cuba, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Poland. Millions? Russia, China, Vietnam, Cambodia. And that doesnt even count the numerous 'revolutionaries' who fought for their own country while killing it off. Dont push this social policy bullshit cause in reality it has no base. Compare that death toll to capitalisms shining beacons of the world; the USA executes an extremely thin ammount of killers compared to this. There IS something wrong with being a communist.  You leftists complain about capitalist nations (of which Nazi Germany WASNT) abusing the proletariat, take a look at your happy and caring communist nations. Every person I know who claims to be a communist is on social welfare, complains about the government who gives them the right to live and wastes hard earned tax dollars in gay cafes discussing poetry and why the government wont allow pink Che Guevara T-shirts. What the fuck is wrong with this society? You all claim that jobs hold you down, jobs are the basis of this society functioning. If you pay a doctor the same as what you pay a toilet cleaner there will be no insentive for him to spend years at medical school. You can all go fuck yourselves and die in a gutter.  	26042

Lord Alexander who's real name was Gjergj Kastrioti, led the resistance against the Turks during the 15th century and this was the only time Albania was independent from the 4th century BC until 1912 AD.

0	\"  i'm just wondering out loud on what  would think if i say that the term \"\"al-nakba\"\" is insulting to the state of Israel? as if the creation of israel is \"\"the great disaster\"\". surely the palestinian exodus is a grave event for the palestinian people and i would not degrade or downplay on it like many arabs have done with the holocaust. but history tells us that these titles are very much politically motivated - otherwise, the palestinian exodus from kuwait (400,000 in one week) would have recieved a similar name. to place it in perspective, the jewish exodus from arab lands did not recieve such a polically motivated title. maybe the title fits because the arab refugees from palestine were never well recieved by the other arabs but i don't think that \"\"the victims\"\" point of view should allways be applied - and i give as example the battle of jenin and also place the innocent claims under further inspection with this link also: 1929 Hebron massacre.  \"	26060

This was a spiteful gaming tactic by Sarah777 who had been denied use of the word Massacre in a different context. The article under its previous name is referenced all over the web for some three years and should not be changed without due cause, else confusion results.  According to Wikipedia a massacre is \"\"the intentional killing of a considerable number of human beings, under circumstances of atrocity or cruelty, or contrary to the usages of civilized people.\"\" This is appropriate here and is usually the case if killings are in double figures e.g. Bloody Sunday when 13 people also died.

You may have noticed that some of the mottos recently have been followed by a date from 2006, or on occasion simply \"\"Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\"\". The reason for this is that Motto of the day is in some very serious need of help. Participation in the project, which has never been especially high, has dropped considerably over this past summer, to the point we have had several days where no motto was scheduled to appear at all. Over the past several weeks, I've been the only editor scheduling mottos at all, but there aren't enough comments on some of these mottos to justify their use. If we do not get some help - and soon - your daily mottos will stop. In order for us to continue updating these templates for you, we need your help.  When you get a chance between your normal editing, could you stop by our nominations page and leave a few comments on some of the mottos there, especially those that do not have any comments yet? This works very simply; you read a motto, decide whether or not you like it, and post your opinion just below the motto. That's it - no experience required, just an idea of what you personally like and what you feel reflects Wikipedia and its community. If you do have past experience with the project, then please close some of the older nominations once they've got a decent consensus going. There are directions on the nominations page on how to do this.  If you have any questions, please let me know, or post on the project's talk page. I'm looking forward to reading your comments on the suggested mottos, and any additional suggestions you'd like to make. Until then, happy editing!  (// \"	26601

0	March 2009 (UTC) :An event horizon is any surface from beyond which no information can ever reach the observer.  Of course, that includes objects of all kinds - in fact, anything moving at or below the speed of light - so in a sense you're right.  An important thing to note though is that the event horizon - in the strictest sense - belongs to the observer, rather than the thing (not) being observed.  In the case of a black hole, the event horizon is the same for all outside observers, which I guess is what you mean by a 'physical boundary'.  The Event horizon article is biased towards this, the most commonly encountered form of event horizon.  The cosmological event horizon is different: since every point in the Universe is receding from every other point with a speed proportional to distance, the event horizon is always a sphere centred on a particular observer, so there is no single 'event horizon of the Universe' (although of course we tend to give a special place to our own event horizon).  :So neither article is wrong, although the introduction to Event horizon gives a misleadingly narrow interpretation of the term, which I'll try to fix.  The cosmological use is however mentioned in Event horizon#Event horizon of the observable universe.  There are more details in Cosmological horizon and Particle horizon.  :  13:10, 6	26771

JHP, if you're talking about the 24.209.30.113 (edit #141014976) entry that I reverted, it is because the content was taken directly from the Incidents page without any regard for either (a) including the references themselves, or (b) not following the WP:BLP policy that was taking place over on that page regarding this specific incident.  If you're talking about the Realkyhick (edit #142152748) entry that I reverted, it's because the entry contained information that was already outdated by information that was updated in the Incidents page, and the link to the Incidents page was also removed by Realkyhick at that time.  If you're talking about your edit #147620955 from the 29th, that was just a copy of the same info from the Incidents page, poorly included, and badly placed in the article  while we all agree that there should be some mention of the incident, including it in the intro section isn't really appropriate either, especially as it (in essence) duplicated information that was posted further down the page.

However, it was not my understanding that a vote would be discounted simply because no explanation was given. Re my username, while I understand that many people harbour predjudice against trolls, my username expresses my belief that in building a neutral, accurate encyclopedia, creative and innovative approaches are helpful. I believe that trolling is an important part of any wiki, and without people who are willing to creatively challenge accepted assumptions and groupthink a community may stagnate or fail to maximise its opportunities. Many people who say they are against 'trolling' are actually, when you talk to them about it, against vandalism, personal attacks or timewasting, none of which I condone. I think that w e need to be more tollerant of different approaches as a community, and more willing to try to understand each other - in that way we can build the best encyclopedia possible. Thanks for you advice, hope to see you around,  	26920

0	\" ::: Yep.  This is one of several cases where the vast majority of the time the pattern is met, it is indeed vandalism.  (I suspect something like 99% or better, but have no actual data behind that, so it's really just a guestimate.)  There are a small number of cases on this and some other of the bot's criteria that are actually false positives.  The error matches a vandalistic pattern, but is actually not vandalism.  In general it has been decided that this is a small enough price to pay for the good that the bot does in rapidly reverting the rest that are indeed vandalism.  In general the bot is supposed to run in Friendly mode, where it will not edit war.  This means that if you get hit by a false positive, just make the edit again and remove the warning from your talk page.  The bot should not revert a second time on the same edit. ::: As for refining, that's tricky.  What was there about those two edits that a bot, a computer program, could have used to identify them as not vandalism?  Sure, the bot could be programmed with the very specific examples of those two edits, but the next time won't be exactly the same.  If we told it that \"\"CITATION NEEDED\"\" was not vandalism, then the next time they used \"\"NEED CITATION\"\", or \"\"CITATION REQUIRED\"\" or \"\"FACT CHECK\"\", then the bot would not catch it.  We cannot anticipate every single way someone might make this mistake.  The radio station edit is even more tricky.  And what about the edits that have nothing to do with citations or radio stations?  We would need solid criteria that would allow the bot to tell that one all-cap edit is vandalism while another is not.  And I for one have no idea what we could use.  New ideas for improving the bot are welcome, but in this case we need very specific ideas for rules that will help a bot tell the difference.  The bot is stupid, and only does what it is programmed to do, nothing more.  It cannot make judgement calls edit by edit. -  \"	26965

0	:Yes you're right, theologically Catholicism is very different to American protestantism which gave birth to the creationist movement and are certainly not interested in the sort of fundamentalist theocracy that most of them want.  Sure, they use the teleological argument, but phrase it in theological language which is a lot different from scientific language and hence it isn't pseudoscience, which is what irks me as a scientist.  But I don't understand theology (probably because I've been trained to think too scientifically).  And the Catholic Church most of the time has better things to do than make statements on scientific issues.  But Catholics are really into authority, so what the hierarchy says, goes. — | 	27021

0	\"  I agree with your ideas about comprehensible articles on physics. I was a physics major in a major university for a couple years, eventually broadened out to other things, but I can still read Pauli and Reichenbach without feeling that I got caught in the spin cycle of a rug washer. The same isn't true of the Wikipedia physics articles.  I've tried to clear up the philosophy of QM article that is under rfd, but Mr. Ingham has not answered my questions about what he is trying to say in a responsive way. The \"\"simplified\"\" article looks like a better place to start.  My experience in physics at the University level may be relevant. We had a trimester system. The first trimester was mechanics. I did o.k., but calculus was new to me. The second semester was electricity. Since I had shocked myself working on old radios, made crystal radios, etc., etc. for years, I already knew what was going on. In some ways I was ahead of our grad student lab leader, who couldn't understand why putting one probe of a volt meter into the DC outlet on the lab bench did not produce a reading. My grade jumped to A, not because I was any smarter, but because I knew from experience what happens when resistors are wired in series and when they are wired in parallel, and to other students such matters were totally abstract. I think that students should begin with real-world experiences as much as possible. Unfortunately, many students live in very restricted environments. If you live in a high-rise apartment building you might not realize you could just trail the antenna for a crystal radio out the window.    It would be nice if you would put something on your user page indicating background, interests, etc.  \"	27098

It depends on routing, but routing can occur without forwarding.  :Routing does not depend on having an aggregatable address.  For example, prefixes blocks on the Internet today are becoming less aggregatable.  This is a problem for BGP's scalability, but it doesn't make BGP less of a routing protocol.  In fact, there exist routing protocols which need no concept of an address at all, such as ROFL , distributed hash tables, many ad hoc routing protocols like DSDV, and various proposals in a research area known as \"\"compact routing\"\" .

Your participation in deletion debates is good.  The main objection in your RfA was \"\"Lack of policy experience\"\".  The basic reasoning is, that it is impossible for avid editors to read pages without editing them, so if you've read the policies and guidelines, that would show up in your contributions.  On guidelines you can generally make minor changes directly to the guidelines themselves.  With policies, unless it is fixing grammar or typos, you pretty much need to post the edits you want to make to the talk page for approval - but that becomes habit after you get used to it.  So my advice is that you start proofreading the P&G;'s, and see where that takes you.  I see David Fuchs has prepared a nomination for you.  Before you accept another nom, you should probably get in around 1000 meaningful edits to policy and guidelines pages and their respective talk pages, and about 500 edits in dispute resolution RFCs, s, some mediation, etc.  Then ask  and  what they think you still need to work on, if anything.

0	\" Here is Lavergne, making the \"\"worst mass murder in American history\"\" claim - from his own mouth, (start 7:00 minutes) []. As to the Gunby death, there are many possible reasons the coroner ruled it as a homocide, that are only known to the coroner. The fact that Gunby decided to stop treatment, that could have prolonged his life, sounds like suicide. However, I've addressed that here on this talk page, and also mentioned it would not be pursued any further. I do not feel, nor ever said any conspiracies were involved, I merely question the length of life and time after the shooting. I feel bad for Mr. Gunby and his families loss. As to Lavergne, read here what he says about where Whitman would be at the time Lavergne wrote this (last sentence) []. Now look up glioblastoma muti-forme grade IV brain tumor, and look at the prognosis - how could Whitman be alive as of 2006 (my best guess for when Lavergne wrote the \"\"Why\"\" article), and/or survived a lengthy trial? No, I do not have his book, but I read enough of it in Austin when it first came out, to know there was something was wrong, because he and I had access to the all of the FBI, APD and Whitman's diaries. I have all of the files and lot of the photos (I don't know if Lavergne does), plus audio interviews with Whitman's victims, professors and friends. A few of the photos in the Whitman article are mine. I represented Houston McCoy and Jeannie Speed, the widow of slain officer Billy Speed. But I realize that makes me have a WP:COI (except for the photos that others say should stay). So I have given you enough to consider, and I will return to my self-imposed ban.

0	\"  ==Philosophy of education== I was surprised that you did not propose to move Constructivism (philosophy of education) to Constructivist epistemology. Why discriminate against Constructivism when you feel so strongly about Behaviorism, Cognitivism, and Humanism?    :Constructivism seems to be more consciously employed within the philosophy of education. I prefer to err on the side of leaving material if there might be a basis for doing so. (In addition, there is an extant article on this with considerable substance.) :There are many schools which strive to provide a humanistic education, and an article could be written about this if there are sufficient sources. This would probably be a little different than an article on humanism as a philosophy of education. Why (I ask rhetorically)? Isn't it less a coherent philosophy of education, than a coherent philosophy, which some have tried to apply in an educational context? :Behaviorism in the philosophy of education, could perhaps be a helpful section of the behaviorism article, but it doesn't seem to justify an article in its own right.     :I write in historical context about what has already happened in education not about what might be or could be, which leads me to suggest that your viewpoint is not one of an educator. As an educator, philosophies of learning and philosophies of instruction are distinct and that distinction is very important. The descriptive and the perscriptive are frequently confused in Wikipedia articles. Unraveling that confusion is a monumental task. the vocabulary used by Philosophy majors and Psychology majors overlaps with the work of Education majors but one does not exempt the other . . . and where there are differences, the differences are significant.

0	\"  == Note to Administrator Regarding Above Move Request ==  To the administrator who will review the above move request.  Note that the names used in these articles were chosen after many months of discussions, discussions that included a wide variety of editors.  The compromise solution was to use Trentino-Alto Adige/Sudtirol, the Province of Trento, and the Province of Bolzano-Bozen.  This was a compromise that kept both the Italian and German usage in the names, and was also the usage in Encyclopedia Britannica (to name just one major English source).  There is slander going on above by Mai-Sachme when he says that individuals engineered this solution, or did it by some form of trickery.  He also went as far as to erase a similar warning to the reviewing administrator.  It is a little shocking, but maybe not surprising, that after a few years a certain editor tries to put things back to how he originally had placed them unilaterally.  Right here what we are seeing is nothing less than than a ambush of this page and I strongly suspect that he has contacted a lot of these editors thru e-mail to ask them to come and support this ambush.   It is no coincidence that within a couple of days all the German-speaking users who happened to be against the compromise solution show up to vote for this.  This is utter abuse of Wikipedia.  So, again, if Wikipedia is at all fair, this move request should be struck down.  It is FACT that in English both the names Alto Adige and South Tyrol, AND Province of Bolzano are in regular use.  Go to any grocery in the United States, and products from this region are advertised as \"\"wine from Alto Adige\"\" or \"\"speck from Alto Adige\"\".  Yet, the same editor who makes this move request (and others who are voting here) has constitently attempted to marginalize the name Alto Adige on this page, or remove its bold typeface next to South Tyrol, or even acknowledge that it is used commonly in English (just review the edits made on these pages over the past year).  What it truly shameful is that this cements the fact that there is no room in these particular people's minds for compromise and to a solution that allowed an Italian/German naming convention.  Wikipedia is NOT a democracy, and this ambush of the page to try to revert the page to a German-centric viewpoint by sending a dozen German-speaking voters here is just wrong.\"	27327

0	\"  == Advice ==   I apologize for your recent difficulties, your block was clearly undeserved. Our governance here at Wikipedia is imperfect and too often administrators abuse the power we grant them. While we can’t prevent it we can work around it - in this case by creating a new identity to bypass your block - what we call a \"\"sockpuppet\"\" account. Officially it’s frowned upon but so long as it’s undetected a sockpuppet is just as functional as a regular account. In fact many current and former administrators are sockpuppet accounts. The instructions below provide an easy guide to creating your new account and avoiding detection.  Instructions # Log out of your Wikipedia account, clear your cookies (google \"\"how to clear all cookies\"\" for instructions) and close your browser # Download a new browser: Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer. This will be your dedicated Wikipedia browser # Follow these instructions to permanently disable javascript in your new browser: Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer # And these to permanently disable java: All browsers # Reset your IP address. With most  ISPs the procedure is as follows: unplug your modem, wait 10 minutes, plug it back in. Use this website (http://www.whatsmyip.org/) to check your IP address before and after to verify it's changed. If it has, great, if not you may have to wait a few hours or a few days before repeating this procedure successfully # Now you're ready to register your new Wikipedia account  Tips :* Never log into your old account from the same network or with the same browser as your new account :* Don't choose an account name similar to your old account name; administrators will use that as an excuse to sanction you :* Don't edit your user page or your talk page straight away; it's a dead giveaway you’re not a new user. Remember, this user is “new” to Wikipedia :* Mess up a little - forget to sign or sign incorrectly, split someone's comment “accidentally” - everything to give the impression this is your first experience editing Wikipedia :* Avoid noticeboards and contentious articles until you’ve made a reasonable number of edits; sockpuppet or not experienced Wikipedians don't appreciate being held to community standards by new users  All done. Happy editing and welcome back. I hope your new experience will be more pleasant.    — John Whales, Founder and CEO of the World Wide Web    This user's real life identity is verified by the following SHA-1 hash:   \"	27612

0	\"  This is a statement regarding your block. First of all, I am the one who has been Wikipedia stalked for over one year now by none other than Delicious Carbuncle, who gave messages through her edits. She followed every single edit and deleted EVERYTHING. She is Pauline Berry and I can provide her IP address if you do not believe me.  She has been too obvious for everyone. I am not accusing her, I have disproved her already with facts. She has absolutely and completely supported and defended the William Travilla exhibition fraud which we exposed to the public as being a 100% criminal fraud. She edited out the facts on the William Travilla page, added links to her friend's website, which is also a commercial website, Melinda Mason who sold copyright infringed DVD's on eBay.   Next stopthe VANITY FAIR hoax. Delicious Carbuncle started a Wikipedia page for Millington Conroy, after I exposed him for being a forger who fooled the magazine with his fakes.  I am being blocked for telling the truth? Delicious Carbuncle is defaming me on her page, you did not see this?  She claims that her interest is not focused on Marilyn Monroe and or memorabilia? Her edits are telling a different story.  Next the Name of the Rose. She followed me twice now into that one. I was shooting 14 days for this movie and my part was 'Jorge's Novice and that was named after the monks, who most of them did not have a speaking part at all. Pauline Berry aka Delicious Carbuncle aka 'Restawhile'  followed me to Wikipedia (since she has Internet stalked me for the past three yearssince she is financed by none other than Mark Roesler, one of the defendants in the biggest exhibition fraud in history.) I am pointing out the facts here.   She is having a speedy deletion fest and she acts as if she is in charge of running the show. She is not. She cannot turn 100% costume fabrications into original Marilyn Monroe worn costumes, and she tried on her blogs to make sense, because she is part of the project and she is making money off of that fraud.  Now you may think that this edit by Delicious Carbuncle is just 'coincidence' or has nothing to do with Pauline Berry, but until we do not find out who truly is behind Delicious Carbuncle I would ask for fairness in this case and I am asking you to also block this person who has been publicly slandering me, with false accusations, with hypocrite statements and simply with lies.  Now I am aware of the fact that they are working in high numbers, and that it is possible that you, blueboy are part of the group who are supporting a mean and sick fraud project which is out and created solely to defraud the paying public with some foolish fabrications.  Delicious Carbuncle's edit which is a message to Ernest W. Cunningham and Jennifer J. Dickinson.   You be the judge if this is just 'coincidence.'  Please be fair and also block Delicious Carbuncle from further edits.    You, Blueboy96 state this one: 'True or not, attempting to out another user is beyond unacceptable. Indefblocked. Blueboy96'   Did you look at Delicious Carbuncle and realize what this person is doing there?!  This edit was posted on Delicious Carbuncle's site and once she realized that she gave herself away, she edited over it, yet I saved it on time.  You have to know that I called up Mrs. Pauline Berry in order to ask her to stop stalking me and to stop supporting one fraud after another. She is a 45 year old musician who also does try Marilyn Monroe imitations from time to time. She asked me years ago for my opinion as an expert on some Marilyn Monroe autographs and I gave he my honest opinion and told her right away that the signed photographs she claimed to have purchased were 100% fakes. She did not take that too well and ever since she is referring to me a 'self proclaimed expert,' she has spent years now on her hateful postings, websites filled with character assassination attempts, comparing me to murderers Charles Manson and John Lennon killer Mark Chapman. Pauline Berry is supporting people who used AIDS infected blood within their intimidation emails and threats. Who threatened to come to my home and burglarize me, harm me, tie me onto a chair and steal my collection. Pauline Berry has been a big part on the public defamation on three people.  Please read the edits of Delicious Carbuncle and see the message. She is referring to my calls to her home, when I attempted to find out why she is supporting criminals.  Who else would this be, instead of Pauline Berry, since only she knew at the time, that I actually called?!      * (hist) (diff) User talk:64.236.80.62‎ (Caution: Vandalism on Peaches Geldof.)

0	>Sorry to do it, but I have removed a mass of unsourced, POV claims that contain only original research. I will be fine re-adding these in if viable sources can be found...  Here's one for you from http://members.aol.com/tedalvy/ts.htm:  :Excerpt from the book by Grateful Dead Bass Player Phil Lesh:  :The unique organicity of our music reflects the fact that each of us consciously personalized his playing: to fit with what others were playing and to fit with who each man was as an individual, allowing us to meld our consciousnesses together in the unity of a group mind.  :For us, the philosophical basis of this concept was articulated by the science-fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon in his novel More Than Human, wherein the protagonists each have a single paranormal talent – telepathy, psychokinesis, teleportation – and are joined by a quadruple paraplegic who acts as a central processing unit. The process by which they become one is called bleshing, from a combination of mesh and blend. (Today’s archetype would be the X-Men.)  Now I'm going to put the page back the way it was.  And I'll add this reference to it.  Moeron, you might want to consider discussing this with us before you go ahead and try to change it again.

0	\":: Thank you. I just tried logging in to this account and it worked (although I did not intentionally reactivate this ID like BWilkins repeatedly asserted). I did not know about the existence of sandbox to build the article before publishing. In fact, no one has mentioned it in all this discussion over the past one day and I discovered it myself accidentally midway through all this. I was only going to use the userpage as a starting point for a spoof page since I liked that one. I was not going to use the jokes or even any of the material. Maybe if Wikipedia wasn't too geeky or programmer-language-like to write articles in, I may not have needed a template, and used just the WYSIWYG editor and be done with it, but that is not the case. Anyway, what I don't understand is why one cannot get outraged by offending behavior? You have acknowledged it was wrong to have a label slapped on by the other editor without speaking to me or bothering to enlighten me. He clearly was more intent on getting brownie points as an editor or whatever it is that gets people here high. However, everyone else seems intent on labeling me as a \"\"troll\"\". Is that the high-handed way of dealing with uncomfortable things around here? Wouldn't they all be offended and outraged in real life if they were trying to make a cake and someone slapped a pink sheet on top of it and squashed it, and walked off without an explanation?  \"	27663

0	==Hey Wkinght94, from Googie Man==  I hope all goes well with you at Wikipedia, and you're as always, enjoying the world's greatest sport.  To answer your question, yes, I am the one who left a nasty message on a user's page whose name now escapes me.  Why did I do it?  He took off the picture of Bobby Abreu that I took, looks like he tried to replace it with a copyrighted photo, and the Abreu article went for a few weeks without an image.  Now I don't mean this as anything personal against you, as I've respected you and your work for years, and you've been nothing but nice to me.  But, what I don't get is this: I can't tell you how many times I've had to re-introduce legititmate images that have been taken down by people who upload stolen images, or images of lesser quality.  This detracts from the quality of articles, and frankly, I think people who detract from the quality of articles should'nt be allowed to edit.  What I don't get is that whenever I pop-off at someone for doing this, I get busted immediately, yet no one replaced the Abreu image, or scores of others that are taken down.  Furthermore, the guy who did this is just another red link - someone who doesn't even bother to fill out a user page.  It's all a matter of common sense and etiquette - it's not the best analogy, but you just don't go to MySpace or Facebook and start putting useless garbage on other people's pages.   Same goes for Wikipedia - you just don't go around making articles worse, that legitmate volunteers have worked for years to constantly improve.  So, I take it upon myself to discourage users who don't add to the site.  And yes, I've been blocked permanently from editing Wikipedia, but look what happened to the guy who was the ultimate reason for my block.  If I'm a jerk, I'm a jerk towards people who deserve it, and these two most abundantly deserved it.  Anyway, sorry this is so long winded.  I miss the old days of Wikipedia, when baseball articles were buried on the 10th page of Google results.  The quality of the overall work was much better.

0	\"  Hey there buddy, I am back:  (a quote from Kenneth Tennyson Phd.)  :::\"\"the sad thing is that our fellow here - freedom skies - appears to have been raised in america or britain and yet he seems more indian than american or british and along with that supports a radical view of the world that is peppered religious ideas... and along with that - he is educated! It is truly sad... if india industrializes and this hindutva movement holds sway, the world will see a flourishing of a very powerful and scary radicalized country.\"\"  Firstly, can you tell me what being American or British is? America and Britain are both made of of various immigrant and former immigrant communities from Italy, Ireland, China, Guatemala, and so forth. So, if Freedom Skies is being proud of his culture, is that evil? Secondly, you have an over negative estimation of countries outside of your clouded world. Suggestion, join the Marine Corps. That is one thing I have learned is understanding the world through travel. Thirdly, I am utterly shocked at your comment on Freedom skies being educated as being a sad thing (if not, a scary thing). Does that threaten you that Indians are educated? Please answer yes or no (no need to give a disertation or oration), thank you. Also, that statement reminds me of when the slaveowners back in the Southern part of America during the civil war used to consider Blacks getting education as a threat to their lifestyle. As a matter of fact, it was illegal for an Afro-American to go to school or even learn to read, since it was viewed as a threat to the racist slave owners. I will even go a further step to say that back then, these racists from the colonial South felt threatened that the slaves would become \"\"a very powerful and scary radicalized community\"\".    Regarding your previous posts, here is some food for thought. In the Marine Corps, as a Gunny Sgt. or someone in command, if you are at a bar or a party, you never show that you are drunk.

Not sure if there is an episode in which he calls himself Enrique, but although it kind of sounds like Ricky, it's an entirely different name, so I doubt Desi Arnaz would have allowed such an error to be made.

0	\"  ::::Whether a particular comparison to Hitler or Nazis is rhetorically persuasive or is excessive (and thus weakens the impact of appropriate comparisons) is not a matter of hard, objective fact (validity, or truthfulness) but, at least in instances where reasonable minds might differ, a matter of subjective appropriateness and degree.  ::::Several years ago the New York Times published a letter of mine, but edited out my correct use of the subjunctive case. When I questioned the editor (very politely and deferentially), he explained the subjunctive is no longer used in modern English except for an assertion contrary to fact (e.g., \"\"If the Earth were flat, then ...\"\")—which my subjunctive usage in the letter happened to be, although I continue to use the subjunctive wherever it is grammatically correct. Was I asleep when the subjunctive case was ripped from my language? Did the Anglos [sic] and Saxons posthumously defeat the Romans and seize linguistic dominance while I was away?  ::::When I was in 4th grade, the teacher taught the class said that it was incorrect to begin a sentence with because. I asked why, and gave her a grammatically correct example of the usage. She acknowledged that my example was correct, but said one should not begin a sentence with because because that often leads to error (she was probably concerned about sentence fragments, e.g., \"\"Because it rained.\"\"). To this day, probably because of my resentment of the teacher dumbing down the language, I begin a disproportionate proportion of my sentences with because.  ::::Peace.   \"	27939

It turns out that comparing Lonnie to Samson was a compliment and  not an attack on a 'dead gay man' as some gay advocate so dramatically (shocked! haha) suggested. Lonnie was NOT gay. He was a normal man who had been raped as a young boy much like Jerry Sandusky raped those little boys in the Penn State shower. This of course led Lonnie to engage in other gay activities despite his better judgement. The man himself did NOT want to practice homosexuality.

In response to a T.V. show host’s question “How are you responding to the rumors about you and Eddie Cibrian,” Leann replied “You know what, everything is so not black and white.” And on another show (Regis and Kelly), the same response: “Everything people read is not… it’s not as easy as black and white.” Also noteworthy is her statement on her blog that “This is a difficult time for me and my loved ones” –again with a complete absence of any denial of the affair. No one has seriously argued that it was not her or Eddie in the video, and I submit that any attempt to do so would simply call into question either the arguer’s intelligence (cf. Moon landing hoax), or else his or her neutrality. But really none of this matters, because – as I said – I completely agree with you that this is currently not Wikipedia material. This is not to say, of course, that it won’t become Wikipedia material. I’m not going to lecture you on what might cause this to become Wikipedia material, because – assuming that you’re as experienced an editor as you say you are – you will already know. Suffice it to say, however, that there are myriad entries of affairs on Wikipedia profiles, and even a cursory look at any of them sheds light on some common features of all. I am sorry if I offended you by calling into question your neutrality. As Wikipedians, we should all strive toward verifiability and away from bias. In keeping with these tenants, I can guarantee you that if this affair rises to the level of verifiability and importance, both in terms of mainstream media attention and cultural impact, that warrants inclusion, I will not be alone in fulfilling my duty as a responsible Wikipedian to support inclusion of said affair. Best, J.M.  	28201

The definition of alternate, as used here, is \"\"a substitute; an alternative; one designated to take the place of another\"\". The group shot cover was designed specifically to replace the original, controversial cover, as the referenced commentary in the article clearly describes. This makes the group shot unquestionably the alternate cover, even if it is more common/recent. The same goes for albums like Light a Fire and Yesterday and Today. So no matter whether we can assert/prove which version is more common, it is blatantly obvious which cover is the \"\"alternate\"\". Indeed, the controversy caused by the original cover, and the subsequent switch to the alternate, is the entire subject of the article's commentary.

0	\"  North Africa is a vast region, a large region that spans a huge geographical locale, much greater than that of Western Europe. Enmeshing all these different groups of people together for the sake of simplicity on your part I suppose is unfair, unethical and false. Much of the information that is posted regarding their origins is false and based on a study conducted in Southern Morocco, near the border of Mauritania. As the studies were conducted by europeans, who often look for the exotic element, we cannot even be sure that these were inhabitants of the region and not maurauders. Basing the findings of this study to for instance the Kabyle people who do not think of themselves as Berber as they are racially apart, culturally as well and even geographically reside mainly in mountainous regions in algeria is absurd and grave. As a native of the region, I am saddened by the distortion of so many peoples on wikipedia, a source that is edited by anyone, people such as the madman who thinks that only \"\"blacks\"\" exist in Africa, which is as the world knows false and an absurd proposition.

0	\"  == Is Brian really an atheist? ==  In the recently aired episode, \"\"April in Quahog\"\", Brian can be clearly observed praying some time after the news report leads the public to believe that a black hole is going to swallow the earth. Also, at the end of the episode, Brian leaves the house saying he made a deal with someone that now that the earth is spared he would go volunteer at the soup kitchen. Based on the context of the situation and Stewie's remark in the background that the 'someone' Brian made a deal with was God, this calls Brian's atheism into question and suggests that he has developed some closeted religious beliefs (though other evidence from previous episodes might lead one to suspect that they have been there all along). There are only two other explanations for this series of events that I can think of: One would be that one of the underlying ideas behind the episode is something to the tune of 'there are no atheists in foxholes', though this is unlikely because Brian can be seen following through with his promise which a person who had temporarily reverted to religion because of fear wouldn't do, let alone that any kind of conservative message is very unlike McFarlane. The other would be that McFarlane is somehow poking fun at peoples' work righteous attitude towards religion, however this is also unlikely because in order to understand the joke, an in depth understanding of what Christianity actually teaches would be required which most people (including McFarlane) likely do not posses.

0	:Hello Gerardw. If you click on Forsena's , and review the edit summaries, it is hard to believe that he's patiently seeking consensus on Kosovo matters. (For instance, Removing data from albanian extermist vandal member Angelo De La Paz). In particular, look at this edit of Battle of Kosovo where Forsena goes against all the cited references, and actually *removes* most of them. On the matter of 'disputed country' versus 'disputed region', if Angelo continues to make that change without getting consensus first, it would be worrisome. Though your point about the Balkan topic ban is noted, since Forsena has not edited any articles since it was announced, it is too soon to give him credit for following it. The announcement that he was under Digwuren restrictions on 7 January seems to have had no effect at all on his edits. I will leave Angelo a note that his editing was discussed here.   	28716

1	\" :no seriousy.  the only thing i think actually did or said against your precious wikipedia policies was saying that \"\"if i really had my way, half of you would be shot\"\".  ignoring for a while the fact that i was obviously joking, it happens to be my religious belief that the human race on a whole would be much, much better off if 95% of the population died tomorrow.  that doesn't mean i go around killing people, or making specific death threats against individuals.  and don't you actually have the sense to realize that if someone says \"\"OH MY GOD YOU ARE SUCH A FUCKING IDIOT, JUST GO DIE ALREADY\"\" that they probably don't want you to die, or more accurately they don't care.  Very few people actually have the emotion required to sit and pray for the death of another person or group of people.  And I am not one of those people.  :If you really wanted to show off what a horrible and insensitive person I am,  edit, which was on a wiki talk page, is probably not the best.  Granted, nothing pisses me off more than people who see letters like я and щ and automatically assume that whatever is written is Russian.  The Cyrillic alphabet is used in many Slavic languages, as well as central asian former soviet republics, and even Mongolia.  So I called someone an idiot.  BOO FUCKING HOO.  maybe he could have said \"\"What language is that?\"\" instead of assuming that it was Russian.  However insulted he was by me calling him an idiot, I can guarantee you that I was at least 10 times as insulted by him calling that Russian.  I am a proud, native Russian, and will not have my culture besmirched with these allegations.  :Your other example how I am a bad contributor is what, a spelling correction?  Or was it the fact that my edit summary was how I felt about the sad fact that niggers can't spell? Don't even think about raising issue of my use of the word.  I live in Harlem.  Around here, that word is used like a comma.  And before you try to tell me the difference between \"\"nigga\"\" and \"\"nigger\"\", there is none.  It's called a dialect.  While for some purposes, it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them, I find it is usually clearer to spell properly.  Also, a nigger, to me at least, is not a \"\"black person\"\". I am not a racist. I do not even draw distinctions between people. In my holy opinion, there is a nigger inside of all of us.  People (like you, for instance) who take offense for no reason (i mean, was saying \"\"black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society, tarred and feathered, strung up on trees, dragged through town by their enormous wangs, etc.\"\"?  No.  And if that is what you heard, I'd like to know why.  Are you black?  98% of the black people I know personally use the word \"\"nigger\"\" more than I do.) are why we as a society still can't get over the silly idea that words are harmful.  Words are not harmful.  Ideas are harmful.  One particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all.  You want to end racism forever?  Stop freaking the fuck out every time you see the word \"\"nigger\"\".  SERIOUSLY.  I happen to be a Priest (and a Docktor), and saving humanity is just one of my many responsibilities.  Fucks like you make me hate it, but I still do it.  That's what a good person I am.  :I forgot what else I was going to complain about.  I mean, I could complain about everything on Wikipedia, not because I am uncivil, but because there are enough Wikipedos to make this community unbearable for normal, well-adjusted individuals such as myself.  If you look at all my page edits, they were all GOOD FOR THE ENCYCLOPEDIA.  Ok, there was one tiny exception - a long time ago, I saw someone changed a caption on Scottish fold to \"\"Winston Churchill\"\".  Someone else reverted it, and I reverted it back.  I felt it was an appropriate caption to that particular image.  But everything else was beneficial to improving the quality of the content.  I may be a little hard on people who are hung up on things that are wrong, but I only do what is right.  That is why I put it on my user page.  I don't do wrong things.  If you try to argue with me, you will be in for a world of hurt.  Butthurt, to be exact.  But you have nobody to blame but yourself.  Unlike you, I actually warn people first.  But no.

It reduced customary exports to Italy, Spain, Japan, Chile, and Peru, selling nearly all of its exportable corn and grain sorghum surplus to the Soviet Union. In return, it received prices of almost 25 cents over the American selling price from the desparate Soviet foreign trade organization responsible for grain imports, Export Khleb. In addition, Export Khleb wooed Argentina into an agreement to sell 20 million tons of corn and grain sorghum, and 2.5 million tons of soybeans to the Soviets over the next five years. The Soviet Vice Minister of Foreign Trade even predicted in April a tripling of total trade between the USSR and Argentina in the next few years.\"\"  And another: \"\"This poor harvest did not prevent Argentina from expanding its grain exports to the Soviet Union.\"\"  And  another:  \"\"Soviet propaganda and other support for Argentina during the South Atlantic war contrasted favorably in Argentine eyes with US support for the United Kingdom.\"\"  \"	28988

0	== Southeastern Oregon ==  Thanks for backing me up there, re: needing sources. I'm really not comfortable with even the existence of the article but haven't had the energy to do the research to prove it's not really a named region. Does anyone ever refer to Southeastern Oregon as a separate entity from Eastern Oregon? It's linked from the article about the current situation at Malheur, but I'm not sure we're doing our readers a service linking to that vs. linking to Eastern Oregon. On the one national radio story about it that I was paying attention to, they said the events were taking place in Eastern Oregon, which seems like enough precision for the casual readerthat is they need to know that it is the rural, conservative part of the state in contrast to Western Oregon.

Maurice Gibb, of the Bee Gees, pronounced his name the British way \"\"MOR-ris\"\".  Meanwhile, Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire pronounces his name the American way, \"\"More-EES\"\".  I believe we should use the pronunciation that García Bernal himself personally uses, seeing as it is his name.  Therefore, the correct pronunciation would be \"\"gar-SI-a\"\".  After all, a person can choose however they want to pronounce their own name.  If he starts pronouncing his name the Spanish way \"\"gar-THi-a\"\" then I would agree that it is pronounced like that.

0	\"  ==Writing new guidelines that general folks understand== 18-July-2009: These recent events have just re-confirmed what I've been telling people for years: Wikipedia runs on mobocracy, despite other people claiming (for years), \"\"No, no, WP decisions are made per logical reasoning, in accordance with written policies\"\". Well, actually, that's not how decisions have been made, for several years, as of July 2009. I'm not quite sure what the problem is with the wiki-masses, in this attitude, that \"\"truth\"\" is a popularity contest. There can't be a massive, multi-year wiki-cabal, so I suspect these mob-judgments are simply what happens when ordinary folk are challenged to think.Many school teachers have concluded that thinking must be taught to most people. In America, people are not allowed, typically, to become official judges without some type of formal judicial education, where they must pass standards of clear thinking. Not just anyone can sit on the bench, and start making decisions that affect thousands of other people.We have to write reality-based guidelines, with totally obvious examples, so that anyone could understand them. The wiki-masses don't follow concepts such as \"\"significant coverage\"\" in reliable sources: I must conclude the current WP policies are like wiki-calculus for the masses. They cannot calculate wiki-integrals of the policies to reach a logical conclusion. Hence, the current policies are a failure for coordinating general editors.So, these bogus AfD discussions are such a waste of time, re-hashing misunderstandings as confirmed by popularity votes. We have to write policy essays to explain actual examples to be followed: I don't think there's any other hope. Most people just don't understand the current policy points, no matter how carefully that text is quoted in discussions. They see \"\"NOTINHERITED\"\" and that's the extend of their reading: 2 words is a policy to them. Perhaps they started to read the policy text (yawn) and re-zoned to the 2 words, period.  To be readable, we must list obvious examples, such as the one-event R.M.S. Titanic generating \"\"50\"\" notables. Plus, those examples must be listed in easy-to-read essays (no consensus required), so when we put \"\"WP:BIGEVENT\"\" they know that, historically, big single events have generated numerous notables (e.g.: Lee Harvey Oswald & Jack Ruby in JFK assassination; Charles Manson & Manson family in Sharon Tate/etc. murders). It's the only way to defeat the notion that exceptions, to the intricate policies, must be determined by intense debates of popularity votes. No, instead, big-event notability can be explained by a simple essay of examples. We need those policy essays to shift the mass voting. -  \"	29180

0	\"  == Comment ==  My comments on Malleus' talk page were well beyond civil, even for a user talk page. They were a personal attack, and warranted serious sanction.   For the record, it was a simple spontaneous eruption of contempt mingled with rage. Some have muttered that I went to his page to harass him; that's not the case. I went to continue a discussion that had been interrupted by earlier admin action. Some are muttering that I went there to \"\"bait\"\" or \"\"poke\"\" him into a block. I appreciate the complement but my Machiavellian intelligence is non-existant. Obviously.   I lost respect for Malleus when he said, \"\"You already succeeded in getting me blocked, so I can only presume that you're trying to repeat the trick.\"\" I had made it clear that I had no intention of getting him blocked, he knew it, and yet regurgitated this populist slur. That's where he opened the door for my unmitigated opinion.  But my rant wasn't aimed at the dishonesty I perceived in that comment, that simply gave me permission to express a much deeper revulsion that's been building in me over the last few months with respect to this project.   It's a feeling, so I'm not sure I can make it clear. A kind of nauseous disgust. It's to do with how we deal with the hurt we may cause others, other editors, our subjects and our readers. I'm pleased to see the faltering steps being taken toward a more civil ethos here. Those who actually know me know that means a great deal to me. There is a long way to go. Pesky pointed out that finding the right form of words for what's required is difficult. I agree. That's the challenge. The right form of words will emerge if we discuss these questions enough.  With regard to respectful discourse between editors, Malleus has been addressing the real root of the civility problem here for years. Telling someone to fuck off, or calling them a cunt is obviously uncivil and an easy call for an admin. But the real evil here is not Malleus and me calling each other names, it's the sleazy aside from one editor to another, undermining the reputation of a third. One editor can bully or badger another for days or weeks without ever calling them a name, and it's their victim that cops a block when they respond accordingly. So I'm glad to see more admins taking civility seriously, but you're going to have to work on the sophistication of your approach.  I'm disgusted by the way this project treats its readers with regard to controversial images. The bit that disgusts me is the mantra that \"\"we don't care if we offend our readers.\"\" Seriously. That has been repeated ad nauseam during the Muhammad images debates and others. I can see no excuse for that attitude, and don't want to participate in an enterprise that has that attitude towards its readership.  And finally, contempt for our subjects. I first noticed this on a BLP. A teenage girl and her boyfriend made a sex tape. Later, when she was a minor local celebrity, the tape was posted on the net, without her permission. It's there now; Google her name and \"\"sex tape\"\" and you got it. She's now won a TV competition, so is becoming better known.  The tape's existence has been mentioned a few times in the press, but not much, and usually the \"\"nudge, nudge, lucky bastard\"\" type of comment, but it doesn't seem to have affected her career or even her private life. An RfC asked \"\"Should we mention the tape?\"\" Policy-wise you can make a case for its inclusion, but it's borderline. What really disgusted me was the utter unconcern of many editors for the effect our inclusion of the factoid would have on the visibility of the tape, and the consequent effect this would have on the woman. I won't elaborate further; you either get it or you don't.  And it was concern for the subject of a BLP that brought Malleus and me together. He was arguing for the preservation of a borderline notable BLP that the subject said was distressing him. I argued that it should go, simply because it's borderline notable and the subject doesn't want it.   Although Malleus asserted the wishes of the subject are irrelevant, an assertion he is incapable of justifying, and a position I find morally repugnant, he deemed it appropriate to also declare the subject's claim of distress is implausible. Unfortunately, Jimbo had already primed me with a similar judgment. Jimbo had ignored my response, so I thought I'd add a little emphasis when I explained my view to Malleus.

My point remains: tables, text additions, etc should be handled individually, gradually and consulting other editors prior to their inclusion because of this article's peculiar size constraints and the amount of effort all editors (including João Felipe), to cut down the article's size. All the content I've removed can and should be easily added to the respective sub-articles. Tables are helpful, but take up a lot of physical space and dataagain, perfectly apt to be relocated to subarticles. Everyone has to resist this temptation to include all this data into a single article.  	29388

0	\" :::::You have now cited only one source (albeit only in the edit summary)  The New York Times. Apparently, however, you are unaware of the close personal relationship between Lindbergh and the author of that paper's stories, Times' aviation writer Lauren \"\"Deac\"\" Lyman, which went back to 1927 when Lyman befriended a then unknown Lindbergh. Lyman was the only member of the press whom Lindbergh told about his decision to go into self exile in Europe, and he did so because he knew that Lyman would paint this actions in terms most favorable to his friend and, with Lindbergh deliberately \"\"unavailable at sea\"\" for more than a week, that this \"\"spin\"\" would initially be repeated by other papers that would pick up the NYT story from that paper's news service. This relationship and the tone of the resulting early accounts based on are addressed in detail in the cited TIME Magazine article on the issue of press coverage published on January 6th. (\"\"Since Colonel Lindbergh had offered no public explanation of his departure, and radiograms sent to him on the American Importer were returned with the notation \"\"Addressee not aboard,\"\" the Times' story remained the scripture on which the week's exegesis was built. It was written by bespectacled Lauren D. (\"\"Deac\"\") Lyman, who as the Times' aviation editor befriended obscure young Aviator Lindbergh before his flight to Paris in 1927. Throughout the week Reporter Lyman stoutly refused to reveal the source of his scoop. But Colonel Lindbergh's hatred of certain sensational newspapers, and his corresponding affection for the courteous Times, have long been well-known. ... In keeping with the Times' policy of protecting Hero Lindbergh's privacy, Reporter Lyman weakened his otherwise first-rate scoop by failing to disclose the time and place of the Lindberghs' sailing, their ship's name, their exact destination.\"\") As Lindbergh's real intentions became known  his intention to live in exile in Europe  it then became clear that this was not just a vacation abroad but that Lindbergh had \"\"fled\"\" the country to protect them from danger that he felt that he and his family were being exposed to in the United States and that he would be living in Europe indefinitely.  :::::Aside from the Times, you have again failed to provide any  citations or sources that support your claim that \"\"the number of sources which use the neutral \"\"left\"\" is huge compared with the single source for \"\"fleeing\"\".\"\" (You also have also again misrepresented the number of sources that I have provided which is FOUR, not one.) You have also claimed that I apparently believe that \"\"flight\"\" and \"\"sailed\"\" are the identical word to \"\"fleeing\"\" when I have made no such claim. Sailed only describes the mode of transportation he used (a ship), nothing more. (The word I was emphasizing with \"\"sailed\"\" was \"\"furtively\"\".)

This being the case, perhaps you would consider a 30 day buffer period before bot-editing articles.  The worst part of this is that the target of your deletion was utterly uncontroversial, and didn't violate WP:BLP in letter or spirit.  Frustrating!

0	\"  == What about the Hillman Minx? ==  I don't see \"\"Minx\"\" as an adjective. It's a noun. Using it to describe a cat seems redundant (\"\"she's a minx\"\" means something like \"\"she's catty,\"\" I thought  \"\"a minx\"\" is some sort of fighting feline).   The Hillman Minx car, in the 1950's, was a very small automobile (smaller than a Volkswagen beetle) its name probably meant to suggest that it was sprightly and energetic despite its tiny size and low power (I only know of it that our family owned two of them  a grey one with yellow ear-flaps, and later a red one  the Minx could not go fast, so its driver had to outwit other cars rather than overtaking them...).   Perhaps the minx relies more on wit and slyness than on physical strength?  \"	29836

The only contemporary scholar that we have to claim that Voisava Tripalda was from Serbian origin is Spandounes, who says only that, and then he points to the biography of Marin Barleti. Now Barleti doesn't say that she was Serbian, but Albanian, so Spandounes contradicts himself. If we really want to give some references to Skanderbeg that are sour, let's start with Oliver Jens Schmitt who really has made a bad biography of the national hero of the Albanians. Schmitt is a voice out of the choir and I would love if someone brings to the table what he says, because I want to see if he is fringe or serious. \"	30060

In principal it could also be used in this and many other places, but let's not abuse the thing. If you look at Special:Whatlinkshere&target;=As_of_2003, you will see that there on the order of five hundred links which haven't updated. If there are two or three thousand I assure you no one is going to check them all. If HM published a new edition every three months, I would wholehartedly agree, but we are talking about eight to ten years. Hence, the text As of 2004, it remains the current edition. is going to go out of date far sooner than is necessary.

0	\"  == removing aircrash investigation additions and calling them spam en third class publications ==  Someone (AndyTheGrump)is accusing me of putting information about aircraft investigations as third class spam mail on wikipedia. This is outrageous and completely ridiculous. I am a aviation specialist, I was general manager of large airports (among others Schiphol International Airport Amsterdam), a professor in economics (graduated Erasmus University, Rotterdam, Netherlands in 1973) and a consultant for many governments world wide (a.o. Netherlands, Indonesia, Chad, Philippines) on issues regarding aviation. I can proof that on every account. The problem with aviation accidents is that every country makes it own report of the accident, many are not in English, not everybody uses the metric system, there are problems in terminology, etc.  Many reports are not easy to obtain, some governments simply refuse to make reports available for international students and/or mechanics in aviation. This is very frustrating for people working in this field. Not everybody is American, there are also Asians, Africans, Russians, etc. who are entitled to the same knowledge as you and me. For this reason we publish these reports all in the same style and the same format and all in English. This makes comparison easy. Because we (a number of retired pilots) are talking over small series and the information has to be available for many years we found the solution in publishing them as print in demand by lulu.com. I do not see what is wrong with this. Publishing via a normal publisher means that the series are too large and after a certain time the publication is no more available, they also become too expensive for people in countries that are not so \"\"blessed\"\" as Americans.  You should appreciate what we do instead of insulting us, we are simply acting on requests of the industry. You are apparently some kind of Johnny the Selfkicker.   Dr. Dirk J.

0	\"2) In 1976 world championship final, Higgins not conceed early before Reardon had \"\"reached the winning post\"\". Reardon won the frame he needed to win the match 27-16. However, Higgins did conceed several frames early when he could still have techniclaly won them. 3)While it is correct that Higgins was ranked number 2 on two occassions (since the ranking list was created in 1976) it is worth noting that for the 1982 / 1983 list, Higgins had two ranking points deducted for misconduct. Otherwise he would have been ranked number one, based on tournament performance.  The article does not list many of Higgins' tournament victories.

0	===Specific points of fact===  There seem to be two issues of fact in question:  * Which instruments are correctly called ten-string guitars? * How many resonances are missing from the six-string guitar?  Viktor maintains that the twelve-string guitar is also incorrectly named, which is the issue on which we first crossed swords. I did not at first understand why it was so important to him, but later I discovered that he believes and argues strongly that only Yepes-tuned instruments and some nineteenth-century harp guitars are correctly called ten-string guitars. Obviously, if a twelve-string guitar is validly called that, then for example a baroque guitar might be called a ten-string guitar, and his chance of having non-Yepes-tuned instruments excluded as he wishes is remote.   So far as Wikipedia is concerned, the main question is this: What should be the scope of the article at ten-string guitar? It seems to me that, under WP:NC, it certainly includes instruments that are built and sold by Ramirez and Bernabe to identical specification to the ones that they built for Yepes, but fitted with a different 7th string (only) to accomodate a different tuning. In fact I would also include any other guitar called a ten-string by its maker, such as the B.C.Rich Bich 10. And if we include that, then where do we draw the line? Wherever that might be, it won't be where Viktor wants it I'm afraid.  So far as resonances go, Viktor has raised this in many other forums. In the ten-string guitar Yahoo! group he was recently asked to list the resonances of the six-string guitar, to clarify what he meant by a similar essay to the one above. He listed nineteen of them!  The point is simply, resonance in this context is not well enough defined to enable us to count them and arrive at a unique answer. Whether we describe the eight missing notes (pitch classes), supplied by four resonant strings, as four resonances or as eight is academic.  Marlow may well be wrong on many other things. We all make mistakes! But this particular issue is a non-issue. Viktor's real problem with Marlow is simply that she is popularising a set of tunings for the Yepes guitar which he does not like.   	30305

0	If you read the most thorough and credible works on the subject (see below), you will see that not only did the so-called Zebra murders flow directly from NOI theology, but that they were an NOI operation, directed from Chicago (aka New Mecca), and run out of the San Francisco mosque. The San Francisco death squad had pep rallies run by dignitaries from New Mecca after hours at the NOI-owned moving and storage where most of the killers worked, and all of them worked for NOI-owned businesses.  ::The apprentice Death Angels had to reach a certain quota from killing either four white children, five white women, or nine white men, in order to become full-fledge Death Angels, and receive free passage to Mecca. The practice of paying free passage to Mecca for killing “white devils” had been  instituted during the early 1930s by NOI founder Wallace Fard.  ::The NOI even paid for the defense of the three killers who refused to confess (Larry Green, J.C.X. Simon, and Manuel Moore), but refused to pay legal fees for the one killer, Jesse Lee Cooks, who confessed to murder (the Frances Rose killing), and went so far as to disown Cooks. The NOI considers it a mortal sin to confess to any crime in the white man's courts.  ::To get an indication of how tightly the NOI operation was run, the case was only broken when one of the killers, Anthony Cornelius Harris, came forward, in order to collect the $35,000 reward, get police protection, and new identities for himself and his family. One day, when Harris & Family were in a motel under police guard, and Harris was in the shower, his foolish wife telephoned the wife of her minister, at the San Francisco mosque, and told her where they were holed up. In no time flat, a squad of NOI assassins (Fruit of Islam types, not the raggedy characters in the “Zebra” death squads) showed up at the motel, and Detectives Gus Coreris and John Fotinos just managed to escape with the Harris family seconds ahead of the assassins.  ::Had the squad managed to kill Harris, the SFPD would never have broken the San Francisco cases (or at least, the 15 official San Francisco cases; there were more killings than that in the city by the bay). As it is, the convictions of Larry Green, J.C.X. Simon, Manuel Moore and Jesse Lee Cooks “cleared” only 15 killings, and the SFPD was convinced that at least three other men were part of the SF squad alone. However, the San Francisco DA, convinced that it had too little evidence to go to trial against the other three, dropped the charges against them.  ::The NOI is so tightly knit in its devotion to killing whites, whom it variously teaches are “white devils,” “blue-eyed devils,” and “grafted snakes,” that no one else came forward with information.   ::Not only did the NOI organize the death squads (there were many more than the one that went down), but the killings went on up and down the State of California, with different squads working different areas, and according to the FBI, even (though apparently, or rather, hopefully, to a lesser degree) on the East Coast. Dick Walley, the head of the Intelligence Analysis Unit at the California Department of Justice, had a dossier of 71 black-on-white murders committed across the state that he was convinced were NOI killings (Howard). (Walley died of cancer before the trial.) Clark Howard, the author of Zebra, was convinced that the NOI had murdered “just under 270” whites across California, but never named the other 255 victims, or explained his rationale. Since the murders were through and through an NOI operation, and only a small minority of them (even using Walley’s figure, which did not count non-California NOI racial killings) were committed in San Francisco, I suggest that we dispense with calling them the “Zebra Murders,” and simply call them the NOI Murders.  ::Contrary to those who have claimed that the NOI was seeking with the killings to cause a race war, the NOI was prosecuting a race war. The real story of how that war was stopped is one that I’m afraid we’ll never learn.  ::Howard, Clark.

0	Although it mentions that he is the first Tamil scribe to meet with Irom Sharmila Xmas 2013 it doesn't point out that it was only after his intervention that the Government of Manipur ended the 9 year illegal isolation order. Up till then anyone trying to meet with her had no idea of the process. They would go via friends or local NGOs who filtered all visits or would just be told it was impossible. Since his visit after the High Court was informed by the GoM that they were adopting hte Assam Prison Manual regulations for all prisoners the procedure to see Sharmila is as follows:  You apply in person to the SSP Imphal Central Jail and fill in a form stating your name address prisoner you wish to see and purpose of visit. Then you pay a ten rupee admin fee and after a brief interview confirming what you are allowed to take with you and what you cannot you are either granted a chit for a twenty minute interview or you are given written reasons for refusal. If you press for written reasons this may change the official's mind. Otherwise it may be recorded if at all that you changed your mind. Visiting days are Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays for women prisoners in Manipur. She is kept at the JNIMS security ward some distance away from the main prison.  Just that.

0	\"  == ban or block? ==  As I understand it, a ban is something imposed on a user by the community appointed Arbcom or Jimbo Wales by fiat for whatever reason, and a block is something any admin does to an individual user account or IP address for predetermined reasons (usually vandalism, sometimes immediately if the vandalism is severe or offensive enough, or in the case of continued actions by users blatantly against policy in the face of multiple warnings). They can both be for a set time or permanent. Bans can be permanent, blocks of user accounts can be permanent, but we don't like to permablock IP addresses. As in the case of Jessica, I blocked (what I believe to be) her IPs for 6 mos., so it ever gets reassigned to another computer after that time that computer can conceivably register for a new user account. Known shared IPs are blocked for much less time. Admins are supposed to use Arbcom mandated block ranges to enforce bans, but don't themselves declare bans on other users in order to block or have other admins block. That way, admin actions can be reversed by other admins or even by themselves if they change their minds, but bans \"\"from above\"\" can't be lifted by admins. Again, this is only how I understand it, others will have their own opinions to be sure. Cheers,  \"	30395

0	== Abuse of 'authority' == Not to burst your petty little power trip, but it isn't exactly fair game to ban someone just because he was right and you were proven wrong. When someone accuses another of being an 'anti-semite' just because the ADL has labelled him as such, I want to point out to to the Wikipedia audience that however horrible it may be, 'anti-semitism' actually originated from the United States, not Nazi-Germany, though it later adopted it from the likes of Madison Grant and Charles Davenport. Wikipedia's own article on Henry Ford states as much, yet when I bring it up in a Talk section, I get accused by the likes of you for vandalism and banned.  It is the sheer height of hypocrisy that you can go around calling people like me a 'crank' and 'conspiracy theorist', yet I get BANNED by you just because I call you a 'deceptive little creature', which you clearly have demonstrated you are. You can CALL ME all sorts of names, yet I in return am not allowed that privilege. You are deliberately colluding with THF and Collect (two other sockpuppets on Prescott Bush's page) to get rid of as much 'inconvenient' information as possible. Perhaps it's just because you're really clueless and really don't know alot - that would be at least the half-way respectable scenario, and the least weighing on your conscience.  You want your audience (who I presume you want to delude, that is, unless you really DID NOT KNOW Henry Ford published The Elders Of Zion) to remain in a paradigm - without ever knowing where anti-semitism originated from and what a joke it is to see the ones who PROMOTED the concept of 'racial purity' and 'Aryan superiority' to Hitler to remain free of persecution. You use that 'ploy', that 'slogan', 'anti-semite', 'crank', as a silencing technique. It's a deceptive con-game, especially when you never get at the heart of the matter - where the anti-semitism came from, who started the ball rolling, and hey, guess what? The source of origin is a very unlikely one, and very unfortunate and inconvenient indeed for the self-righteous Americans always eager to trot out charges of 'anti-semitism'.  Unfortunately for you, and your sources, Prescott Bush's collusion with the Nazis is a well-established fact, and is well-documented in numerous high-profile books on the subject, including Trading With The Enemy: An Expose of the Nazi-American Money Plot. What you have constructed thus far are 'strawmen' arguments and falling back on 'guilt by association'. You peddle establishment sources as the ultimate harbinger of truth, perhaps KNOWING or NOT KNOWING the complete collusion of mainstream news with the establishment. More unfortunate for you, still, is that President Calvin Coolidge, Woodrow Wilson, Margaret Sanger, the father of JFK and countless other Americans clearly believed in the Nordic/Aryan races' superiority and viewed the Nazis as good. Worse still is that FDR refused to take Jewish refugees from Nazi-Germany. Even worse, university professors were making statements in 1936 to the tune of 'Hitler is beating us at our own game - race hygiene and sterilization'. This is all documented in books such as Edwin Black's 'War Against The Weak' - and don't come with your silly, puny little slogan such as 'conspiracy theorist' just because you don't care and don't want to know.  Unlike you and your petty insults and one-liners, I can back up all these claims with facts and more. I can only conclude that you're a weak-minded yuppie who really does not CARE about the facts, but whether or not you can hang out with your equally deceptive Wikipedians, gain some 'street' credits and keep people in a deceitful paradigm while slandering people who want to break out of your make-believe reality. And of course, being an American, you want to uphold this concocted, grand noble myth that you're the good guys and you fought Nazism. I can only tell you haven't looked into the eugenics history of your own country, or the Royal Institute of Intl. Affairs Conference of 1938. You didn't read Edwin Black's War Against The Weak, haven't you? You haven't read Eugenics And Other Evils by Chesterton, huh?  We live in the information age, sonny. Ignorance is no veil to hide behind - and neither are petty and childish retorts like 'crank', 'anti-semite' or 'conspiracy theorists'. So lose that beard of yours and that smug grin (BTW, not to hurt your ego, but you don't look all that great), quit being so gullible, because I have a newsflash for you, if you keep sticking your head in the sand, you're gonna get hurt real bad too, bubba - by your own masters. The only thing you're doing is discrediting Wikipedia even further by engaging in clear deception.  And if it serves your power trip, go ahead, ban me again. Do what thou wilt.

0	\":::Gimme a break Harlan.  I find it incredible that you seem to think these are \"\"Waldorf\"\" goals.  Educating the \"\"whole child\"\" - right - like anyone sets as their goal the education of half a child.  These are, to be sure, Waldorf buzz words - the kind of language Waldorf brochures are filled with - of course.  But they are meaningless in the framework of an encyclopedia article.  They are sensationalism.  They don't deserve mention at all - except in Waldorf brochures - and that's NOT what we are creating here.  And, really, there are lots and lots of examples in which the reality contradicts the \"\"surrounding the child with moral goodness\"\" you are describing.  The easiest to point to is that Waldorf teachers read Grimms fairy tales to the children and promote them to parents to read to their children.  These are the uneditied versions with the \"\"grimm\"\" stuff in them - the types of stories that are filled with immorality and horrible images for young children.  I can recite examples directly from them here but I'm sure everyone knows what I'm talking about - think Hansel and Gretel and all the immorality that goes on in that one.  These are definitely NOT themes of \"\"moral goodness\"\" - they are outrageous themes of depravity.  So again, what we have here is brochure language that, in this case, doesn't even reflect what goes on in Waldorf.  It needs to come out.  Setting up more sections and going into greater detail about each of the \"\"stated goals\"\" is a bunch of hooey as well.

The legend - which may be true - says that it comes from an old Turkish word, Lofat, which was a torturing device back in the 15th-16th century. It's a long stake or pole used for impalement. See picture here. As the picture shows there was such a device, but I have no sources if it was called lofat. Could you please tell me if that or a very similar turkish word existed in the middle ages?  Thank you! Best regards  	30647

0	That is understandable and will not happen again. But people ganging up and abusing their athority to take down a company who has done nothing to them is crazy. Once an editor who has a grudge or motive decides to remove a listing the rest join in and agree because one person decides to disagree. It is not proper form and there should be rules against that as well. Their should be special top editors for each type of thing......like toys for eg. That way people can't just gang up and remove something because they think it is power to do so and will hurt the person who wanted it to stay or took the time to create it.

0	\"   ==My Offer Anent My Unblock== I am back to pursue my case, not in the form of \"\"trolling and harassment\"\", but in a polite, urbane manner. I ask that you bear with me on this.  ===History=== From alpha to omega, here is an aperçu. My work on Wikipedia commenced rather abruptly when I made my debut using . My subsequent edits were along the same line. I was promptly blocked for vandalism. In retrospect, I understand that my edits were definitely not constructive, but I would not construe them as vandalism, as I was just an abecedarian then.   I returned with  to \"\"\"\". I was quite hostile to Jpgordon and continued to argue my case quite impolitely, insulting other users. After making my only constructive edit, I was blocked for \"\"trolling and harassment\"\". I continued to argue against my block, and my block settings were changed, disabling me from editing at all.  I returned with , truly thinking I was reformed. I created my userpage declaring that I was the alternate account of Hiineedrequestforcomment. I made several improvements to Julia Mancuso, Shaun White, Ted Ligety, Purna, Akola city, and 2010 Winter Olympics, but then I started arguing with users about the ranking of the 2010 Winter Olympics medal table. I do admit that my actions were quite inappropriate. Après reading my userpage promulgation, Andrwsc blocked me. I asked him tersely, \"\"Does [my block] mean that all indefinitely-blocked users cannot ever return to Wikipedia to make changes, even if they are helpful?\"\" This prompted him to change the block settings of Hiineedrequestforcomment to allow me to make my offer. Here I am now.  ===Declarations=== *I pledge allegiance to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit. However, that promise has unfortunately been denied to me. *I promise to let sleeping dogs lie. It was my obsession with pursuing justice of that petty IP that led to my downfall. *I promise to continue making constructive edits. The following are the inexhaustive diffs for all the constructive edits I have made: :#Bode Miller :#Julia Mancuso :#Shaun White :#Ted Ligety :#Purna :#Akola city :#2010 Winter Olympics :#And many more. . . *I issue an apology to all those editors who have construed me as a detriment to Wikipedia.  ===Final Thoughts=== *The year of 2009 was an annus mirabilis, but my only regret was not coming to Wikipedia earlier. *To Andrwsc: you didn't think much of my constructive edits. Yes, they may not have promoted articles to Featured Article of Good Article statuses, but nonetheless, they were improvements to the general quality of Wikipedia.Also, I don't understand why you are giving me this chance when you say at the Administrators' noticeboard that you \"\"would personally !vote oppose to an unblock\"\". Does that mean I have no chance of getting unblocked? *I will assay to refrain from argufying that may launch into a full-scale argumentum. *I hope to participate in the development of an accurate, just, collegial ambiance here on Wikipedia. For me, in the aftertime, I hope to develop mutual understanding with my fellow editors. My amour propre is quite high now, so please don't ruin it. *I hope you will help me help Wikipedia by unblocking me forthwith and allowing me to apply my abracadabra to those articles stark	30681

0	== Techno music Page ==  Qwyrxian, what's up, I have some questions for you, maybe you can help. If I find that one or a few editors are 'ganging up' on me again (on the Techno music page), trying to silence information before the public reads it ie. a request for citation (Check in the View History this week for article), is there some channel on Wikipedia to report the incidents to 'higher ups'? Are there some editors who have some over-riding power? The incidents are on the Techno page. I've added that request tag for inline citations, and the guy keeps reverting my requests, for statements that have no citation. As per our previous discussion, I think the request for citation should be allowed to stand for 2 months, to give editors time to get their sources. I don't think there is anything wrong in asking for the source, but he keeps reverting my request. Also a european added some information, and these guys keep deleting it, because it's outside of 'Detroit'. Let me know if there are any channels to raise my case to.

0	== CEREMONIES AT MINDROLLING MONASTERY ==  Vajrasattva Drubchen- 10th Day of 1st Lunar Month  The Vajrasattva Drubchen is a seven day ceremony based on the Minling Dorsem or Mindrolling Vajrasattva ritual. Minling Dorsem is part of the Vajrasattva cycle of teachings discovered by Chogyal Terdag Lingpa. The Drubchen is held every year for seven days beginning on the 10th day of the 1st lunar month. This grand ceremony is performed to purify the negativities of all sentient beings, particularly of the deceased. On the 15th day of the 1st lunar month sangha gathers to perform a special ceremony for those who have died within the previous year.   Kagyed Drubchen- 24th Day of 1st Lunar Month  Beginning the 24th day of the 1st lunar month, the Drubchen is a ten-day ceremony. It is based on the Kagyed De-Sang Du Pa terma that is one of the treasure teachings discovered by the renowned Terton Nyang Ral Nyima Woezer and later revived by Terdag Lingpa. When Terdag Lingpa was about to pass into Parinirvana, it is said that he asked his disciples and sangha members not to weep but to realize the truth of impermanence. He then instructed them that if they had devotion for him and truly wanted to benefit beings they should do the Kagyed ceremony each year. This, he said, would benefit the Dharma and all sentient beings. In accordance with the instructions of the great Bodhisattva, from that time on, the Kagyed Drubchen has been held every year, now being performed at the Mindrolling monastery in India. The final day of the ceremony is on the 2nd day of the 2nd lunar month, which is the Parinirvana Day of Terdag Lingpa. There are lama dances in the evenings of each day’s ceremony. The drubchen ends in the evening of the 3rd day of the 2nd lunar month with the ritual of Bgodrub Lenchog, the Receiving of Siddhis Ceremony and Marme Monlam (butter lamp ceremony). These are open to the public.  Tsechu Drubchen- 8th Day of 2nd Lunar Month  Since the heat in India makes it impossible for the dances in this ceremony to be performed in the 5th lunar month as they were in Tibet, this Drubchen is held for three days beginning on the 8th day of the 2nd lunar month. The tsechu Drubchen marks the birth of Guru Padmasambhava and is done in accordance with the terma, Lama Sangha, which was discovered by the great treasure master Guru Chowang and later revived by Terdag Lingpa. On the 10th day of the 2nd lunar month,a full day’s Lama Dance is performed in accordance with the ritual of Lama Sangdu. These lama dances are renowned for their blessings and are the foremost examples of the lama dances in Tibet in their original form. Many people come from all over to receive the blessings of this great ritual. On the next day, His Holiness Mindrolling Trichen would bestow a long life empowerment to the public in order to dispel the obstacles and difficulties in the coming year. The tradition has been observed down to the present day since the Tsechu Drubchen was performed in Mindrolling. It has been an opportunity both for everyone to receive the blessings of the Mindrolling Trichen and for the coming together of the monastic and lay sangha.  Saga Dawa Drubchen- 15th Day of 4th Month  This Drubchen held on the 15th day of the 4th lunar month marks the birth, enlightenment and mahaparinirvana of Shakyamuni Buddha, one of the most important occasions throughtout the Buddhist world. Special prayers, rituals and butter lamp offerings are made during the ceremony.  Tel-da Tsechu- 10th Day of 5th Lunar Month  This auspicious ceremony marks the birth of the Guru Mahaguru Padmasambhava. This drubchen is performed for three days in accordance with the Lama Sangdu text from the 8th to the 10th day of the 5th lunar month. Suring the Drubhcen, secial feast practices are done and the Tsog ( feast offerings) is distributed to the general community.  Yarne, the Summer Retreat- 15th Day of 6th Lunar Month to 30th Day of the 7th Lunar Month  This is the rain retreat for one and a half months from the 15th day of the 6th lunar month to the 30th day of 7th lunar month. The retreat is held in accordance with the instructions of the Buddha in the Vinayana Sutra directingall monks to observe certain restrictions and engage themselves in meditation and practices for the period. Khenpos and Lopons give teachings each day and “So-Jong” or confessions are offered by the sangha during this retreat. Many butter lamps are offered and pujas are done during the retreat. On the evening of the 30th, the last day of the retreat, selected monks give teachings and expound the Dharma to the community. The retreat is usually followed by a 3-5 day holiday break for the monks.  Drubchen for the Nine Dharmapalas- 27th Day of 7th Lunar Month 	30862

0	\"Blacks have extremely low visual memory so it is very difficult for them to recall digits in reverse.  Race and intelligence (explanations)#Spearman's hypothesis  IQ tests contain one or more sets of test questions of different varieties. Individually administered tests often are composed of subtests that have different homogeneous item contents. The mean Black-White difference varies considerably across tests with different contents. For example, the BW gap is larger on tests that require the recall of a series of digits in reverse order than on tests that require the recall of a series of digits in forward order. Across a large number of test, the standardized mean Black-White gap varies from near zero to over one standard deviation. According to , \"\"this variation between tests in the size of the standardized mean W-B difference is not explainable in terms of test bias or in terms of differences in types of item content or other formal or superficial characteristics of the tests.\"\"  \"\"The g-based factor hierarchy is the most widely accepted current view of the structure of abilities\"\" Correlations between an IQ subtest's g-loading, and the magnitude of the Black-White-East Asian score gap for that subtest (;  pp. 47-8;  pp. 138-9).  For example, the Black-White gap is greater on backward digits span (a test where subjects repeat digits in the reverse order that they are given, and the more g-loaded test) than forward digits span (a test where subjects repeat digits in the same order that they are given, and the less g-loaded test).  As predicted by Spearman's hypothesis, the B-W gap is largest on the most g-loaded tests.  Narrowing of the B-W gap has been seen mostly on less g-loaded tests, such as literacy tests. Murray, C.  (2005) \"\"The Inequality Taboo\"\".  Commentary Magazine, September 2005. Arthur Jensen argues that there is no independent evidence that the environmental explanations commonly given for the Black-White gap (for example, \"\"past history of slavery\"\", discrimination, \"\"caste status\"\", \"\"peer pressure against 'acting white'\"\", etc) have an effect on g (, p. 510). |The author of multiple factor analysis, L. L. Thurstone (1947), warned \"\"we must guard against the simple, but common, error of merely taking a first centroid factor, a first principal component, or other mean factor, in a test battery and then calling it a general factor\"\".  \"\"Spearman's g, then, is a \"\"statistical artifact.\"\" (C. Loring Brace, 2001)  The gap is larger to recall digits in reverse because blacks are much lower in visual intelligence.  \"\"a test where subjects repeat digits in the reverse order that they are given, and the more g-loaded test\"\"  IQ tests are biased against blacks because they are designed to test people with high visualspatial intelligence.  This is obviously original research, but I cannot find no sources that supports my argument (even though I am not black).     \"	31169

The policy on category deletion is still being discussed, but as far as I am aware, this is not a controversial deletion because you can't redirect categories, so empty ones already replaced by something else can only be deleted. The Conservative Party (UK), Hove and Herbert Stanley Morrison still exist, so perhaps these were only temporary deletes for page moves?

It seems silly to summarise the table when it's there right after the comment.  On the lesbian contributors it seems wrong to pick them out for specific mention (there are probably 20-30 articles written by lesbians/women throughout the ten issues) when the male contributors who weren't members of the collective don't get mentioned explicitly.  Is there a time scale on getting this sorted? (It's 9.30pm here in the UK)? I'll do what I can tomorrow but I have work to do as well. 	31338

0	\" :If using hubs there is a limit imposed by the need for a collision to be detected everywhere, iirc it's officially two hubs for fast ethernet (though in practice you may get away with more due to shorter than required delays in the hubs) but hardly anyone uses hubs anymore so this is largely irrelevent in modern network design. Switches either seperate collision domains or eliminate them entirely so this isn't a problem on a switch based network. Eventually the delays would build up to the point where higher level protocols started to time out but the network would have to get huge for that to happen with most protocols. :Practically there are several other troublesome factors. One is that switches rely on storing the mac addresses of every machine on the lan to decide where to send packets. If there are too many machines for the switches to store the switches will \"\"fail open\"\" and end up broadcasting traffic they don't know where to send to the whole network. Furthermore being a tree network a lot of traffic will tend to cluster on the center of the tree (the impact of this can be reduced by making those parts of the network higher speed or by using techniques like port trunking).\"	31342

0	\"  == To all of you who think this can not be true ==  I live in Sweden. My sister was locked up against her will in a similar institution here in Sweden (but run by the municipality) when she got her first child without being married. And the bureaucrats tried to take her child. In that institution there were a number of women locked up that just had given birth. Their only \"\"crime\"\" being that they got a child without being married, the father of the child \"\"being absent\"\" and not protecting the woman and the woman not having a family that could protect her.   When my family finally found out where my sister was we managed to liberate her. (The bureaucrats clearly had not realised that my sister had a big family that could protect her.) After that the bureaucrats attacked us by all legal (and illegal) means at their disposal. We had to keep my sister hidden from the authorities for several months while we informed the politicians and gathered evidence to defend ourselves against the bureaucrats. Finally with the help of some politicians the bureaucrats were made to stop their efforts to take my sisters child and locking her up again. Afterwards our lawyer said that as far as she knew we were the first family ever in Sweden to manage to keep a child in spite the bureaucrats being on full attack. And this happened as recently as 1999-2000.  Why the bureaucrats do these things I don't know. Perhaps there is black money to get in the adoption business or they simply do it so they \"\"have something to do\"\" so their department won't get downsized. The scary thing is that this is an ongoing thing, defenceless women (but good mothers) are still being locked up and get their babies taken like that in Sweden.   A disillusioned Swede \"	31384

0	\"  To Aeusoes1 - Rewriting content, with no knowledge of the particular topic, and without looking at any sources, as you admit to doing, is the ANTITHESIS of what Wikipedia contributors should be doing. The majority of the article's content is careful paraphrasing of information from the sources. That is supplemented by quotations. Paraphrases are essentially careful re-wordings of quotes. When you, with no knowledge of the source texts, significantly change the paraphrases, you might as well be changing the direct quotes.  As for WP:BOLD, it states: *\"\"... but don't be reckless!\"\" *\"\"If you expect or see a disagreement with your version of the article, and you want to change or delete anything substantial in the text, it's a good idea to list your objections one by one in the talk page, reasonably quoting the disputed phrases, explaining your reasoning and providing solid references.\"\" [italic added] *\"\"Then, wait for responses for at least a day: people edit Wikipedia in their spare time and may not respond immediately. If no one objects, proceed, but always move large deletions to the Talk page and list your objections to the text so that other people will understand your changes and will be able to follow the history of the page.\"\" [italic added] *\"\"... avoid deleting information wherever possible\"\" [italic added] *\"\"Be bold in contributions, but not in destructions. Editing is a collaborative effort, so editing boldly should not be confused with reverting boldly.\"\" [italic added]  You wrote: \"\"I really don't see how your knowledge of Hawaiian is relevant to my edits\"\". Because I have near-native fluency in Hawaiian, as well as a PhD in Linguistics, I know that your uninformed attempts to rewrite the description of word stress, throwing out \"\"D\"\" as a symbol for diphthong, are doomed to failure. For example, you made it have \"\"3. (C)VV\"\" as a stress unit. If V expands as a diphthong, then \"\"wiuiu\"\" can result - an impossible stress unit in Hawaiian. That's only ONE of MANY errors your edits cause.  More importantly, your rewrite is not supported by any sources. You failed to cite any references, and admitted that you don't care to look at any.  You wrote: \"\"My edits were all about format and not substance\"\". That is false. See the preceding two paragraphs. Your rewrite of the word-stress content is substance, not format.  You wrote the phrase \"\"blindly revert\"\" to describe my restoration of the original version. My revert of your edits is informed, not \"\"blind\"\". I've seen an edit summary you wrote in the history of another phonology page where you made the same accusation against another user who undid your edits.  You point to the \"\"layout\"\" of other phonology pages, calling it \"\"precedent\"\". However, the Russian (RUS), Arabic (ARA), Romanian (ROM), Polish (POL), and Danish (DAN) phonology articles are not in compliance with Wikipedia guides. POL and DAN have no lead section. The leads of RUS, ARA, and ROM, violate WP:LEAD. None of those articles use boldface properly. ROM and POL have no references at all. RUS has only 2 old refs, ARA only 1 old ref. DAN has 8. None of those articles have even ONE CITATION to a reference. The \"\"layout\"\" of those pages is not consistent.  In contrast, the Hawaiian phonology article (HAW), as originated by me, has a proper lead section, proper use of boldface, 8 references, and 70 citations to those references. HAW is one of the best-supported linguistics articles currently on Wikipedia.  I will undo your edits by restoring my last version of the article. Because you have persisted in \"\"forcing\"\" your unsupported and objected-to edits into the article, I will ask a Wikipedia administrator to take a look at the situation. I will SUPPORT good changes, such as Jeioosh's idea about the stress-mark character. But I will OPPOSE bad changes, such as your uninformed edits.   \"	31405

0	== Some problems with Soviet and Russian casualty statistics ==  1-Partisan & Militia deaths of 400,000 are included with civilian deaths. 2 –POW losses of 1.6 million are included with civilian dead. 3- Losses of   2.3 million in western Byelorussia & Ukraine are included with Poland by western historians. The Russians include these losses with the USSR. To avoid duplication these losses need to backed out of Soviet or Polish losses. 4- To arrive at the total loss of 26.6 million the Russians assume only 450,000 persons emigrating after WW2. The actual emigration was about 1 million which means losses were overstated by about 600,000. 5-The Soviet population recorded in the 1939 census was 168.5 million not 170.5 million. Stalin ordered the number to be falsified. 6- Soviet civilian losses of  about 3 million persons due to famine in the territory not occupied by the Germans are included in the total losses of 26.6 million. . 7-The Germans had 1 million Soviet deserters in their Army. 215,000 were killed in action. The need to be included with German losses 8- In addition to the war losses of 26.6 million the Russians and the PC crowd in the west  tend  to ignore the1.7 million Soviet citizens that died due to communist terror ( I realize is not NPV but it is a fact that can’t be ignored) 9-Rule of thumb should be to check and analyze Soviet & Russian claims of losses.

0	\" ==Change of title== The peer review assessment mentioned that the article is clearly not about a legend, but about a personage, Red Horn, who is the protagonist of various stories (legends, myths, etc.). The object is not just to give an account of legends, but to describe the state of knowledge on this deity. The Winnebago describe him as a man, but in a very broad sense, like the Norse mann, which denotes not only mortal humans, but members of various divine races. Given that English is a little more restrictive in this way, I don't advise \"\"man\"\" in the parenthetical part of the title. \"\"Deity\"\" is probably safe enough when broadly construed. He is at least a supernatural being. He is not found in Algonquian sources, nor in Caddoan. One can adduce by argument other cognates all of which are from Siouan tribes. It is probably safe, therefore, to describe him as a \"\"Siouan diety\"\". This is based on what we know, archaeological speculations aside.\"	31493

0	\"  == Suggestions / Concerns ==  Intro paragraph: Ante Pavelić (14 July 1889 – 28 December 1959) was Croatian fascist leader,[1] revolutionist[2] and politician.[3] He ruled as Poglavnik[note 1] of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a World War II puppet state of Nazi Germany in Axis-occupied Yugoslavia.[4] In the 1930s, he was a founding member and leader of the Croatian fascist[5] ultra-nationalist separatist movement, the Ustaše. In 1941, having been installed by the Axis occupation as leader of a Croat puppet state, he instituted a racial policy that led to genocide over hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews, and Roma in the NDH concentration camps, along with Croat political opponents and resistance members. At the end of the war, Pavelić escaped abroad. He died from wounds caused by an assassination attempt in Madrid on 28 December 1959.  Incorporating the term fascist is POV. Ante Pavelic was not the leader of Croatia's Fascist Party (one has never existed). The term puppet state is also POV, out of all the countries mentioned in the Eichmann trial, Croatia was the only one that a notable Nazi considered to be a sovereign republic. If we can not change the \"\"puppet state\"\" tag, such information should be included because it would support the neutrality of this article. Axis-occupied Yugoslavia is also an irrelevant term as Yugoslavia did not defacto exist then (the one that was formed after the war was not the same as the one prior to, neither of them had defacto or dejure control) and today these regions have different names. If anything I would suggest that it be noted within Axis-Occupied Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina if anything. Saying that the Ustasa movement was installed is also POV. Hitler first wished to keep together Yugoslavia and tried to install Vladko Macek, which didn't happen. Slavko Kvatrenik declared Croatian independence prior to German's entering Zagreb and they simply accepted it. If the Ustasa movement was installed it couldn't have been by several parties at once, and if so, those parties would have recoginzed Croatia's independence that very day. Italy actually recognized Croatia a week or two before Germany did. The latter part about a racial party is nonsense. The Ustasa leadership instituted a Racial Policy towards only Jews. It should be noted that this Racial Policy was the only European anti-semitic policy that has unique notions granting special aryan status to Jews who supported the Croatian statehood cause prior to April of 1941. To say that Pavelic escaped is also misleading because ally special service agencies knew where he was the whole time.   \"	31764

0	\"  Its is common knowledge in South India as to who the Sengunthar/ Kaikolar are and its not my problem if you've been living in a very close knit community or unaware of this.  1. The following is quoted from a legitimate third party website. http://globalindiamissions.org/newsletter/nwsltr0802.htm  The Kaikolan are a large Tamil and Telugu caste of weavers. There are seventy-two subdivisions (nadu or desams). Their name comes from a mythical hero and from the words \"\"kai\"\" (hand) and \"\"koi\"\" (shuttle). They consider the different parts of the loom to represent various gods and sages. They are also known as Sengundar, which means a red dagger, which is traced to the legend of the earth being harassed by demons, which led to the people asking the god Shiva to help them.  Traditionally, one girl in every family was set apart to be dedicated to temple service and becomes a \"\"Devdasi\"\" (meaning female servant of god). In the temple, the girl is considered married to the temple deity but in practice becomes a prostitute, especially to the Brahmans and she learns traditional music and dancing.  2. This is taken from a journal research article with abundant valid references. This is as legitimate as it gets.  This article talks in much detail about how women from the Sengundhar/ Kaikola caste get into the sacred prostitution in temples.  \"\"Contending identities: Sacred prostitution and reform in colonial South India Priyadarshini Vijaisri A1, A1 Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), New Delhi\"\" South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies Publisher: Routledge, part of the Taylor & Francis Group Issue: Volume 28, Number 3 / December 2005 Pages: 387 - 411  To view the complete article just register, its free.  Here are the links   http://journalsonline.tandf.co.uk/link.asp?id=jv31l27518262711 If you cannot access it then just go to the following page and follow one of the links  http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q;=Contending+identities%3A+Sacred+prostitution+and+reform+in+colonial+South+India  3. This is taken from another legitimate webiste http://www.go2southasia.org/l_peoples.html of a world renknown organisation recognised by many countries. They have no gain in just picking on the Sengunthar caste.  The KAIKOLAR people are a caste of weavers 1.5 million strong in southern India. They are Hindus and view different parts of the loom as representations of various gods and sages. Traditionally, each Kaikolar family sets aside one daughter to serve in a Hindu temple. That daughter is considered married to the temple deity—often the Hindu destroyer god Shiva. In practice, the daughter becomes a temple prostitute.  All 3 of the above references are quite legitimate and I can quote many more. There is no question of coincidence or any error in any of these sources.  \"	31812

0	:It's a good question. I've kind of gone back and forth on it over the years, but I've been finding lately that when I've been updating licensees as a result of an acquisition, I've been linking the licensees to the owner's page more often (or at least when I remember to do so). In fact, while I was FCC-less today, I was starting to look at categorization of the larger owners, which is kind of related. The only reason I did the iHeartMedia linking today was because I checked my Watchlist last night for the first time in a while, and saw that there'd been a bunch of changes made in error to the licensees a week or so ago. I figured that while I was cleaning them up anyway, adding the link made sense, and then it was suggested to me that the redirects made more sense than the piping.  :Yes, I'd say each of the state pages should absolutely be uniform, just the same as how the alphabetical lists are uniform and the frequency pages are at least uniform-ish. I'd lean toward linking all of the columns other than the frequency, although I wouldn't suggest redlinking licensees where the owner doesn't have a page. That said, that's just my opinion - it's a question that should probably be put to the project, to see what those who are still active in the project think. It'd be a big chunk of work to implement if links end up having to be added, although it's the kind of gnoming that's right up my alley, as you know. >)   	31824

0	\" July 2006 (UTC) :Well, yes, that's fine, but the point here is that there is no publisher's statement made about anything in that sentence. The idea behind having a resource is that we copy what the resource says instead of just listing them as a reference. If the resource says, \"\"Joe at worms\"\" then we write \"\"Joe ate worms\"\". About tarnishing any reputation, that isn't the point at all. And about accepted practices in the publishing world, this is Wikipedia and the accepted practices are covered by what we call \"\"policy and \"\"guidelines\"\" since those came about over a long period of time and through the process of consensus. About people keeping records of how many books were published, I think you missed the point there. Publisher's Weekly magazine has a statement about the number of books among other things for example. They are a secondary source. Do you see how that's different?

Besides can I ask how is keeping her name a secret going to protect her dignity. It is not the victims but criminals who hide their names. The girl had done nothing wrong but wrong was done to her. Why should her name be kept secret? People should know who that girl was. Revealing her name will be true respect to her. This was the same thing her father said too and you think that by hiding her name you are respecting her. No you are doing the total opposite.Not only that her name is completely verifable. Wikipedia is not a place for personal opinion but still revealing her name will inspire people. People made a publicity of her death and you say I'm the one disrespecting her. Looks it's easy to blame those weaker than you. If you really respected her you would have said that those who made her death a publicity event were the ones who didn't respect her. Tell me can you say to a political leader who is using her name for political agenda. Of course not because he's way more powerful than you. It's easier to blame the weak and tell them.they're doing the right thing but we can.never do that to those more powerful than us. Think again before saying that I don't respect her.

0	::::::(ec with Marskell) Ottava, You seem to be very upset about this, and I am really clueless as to why (and why you hold this position about NPOV and consensus). Using your reasoning, we should never be able to oppose on comprehensiveness issues either, because if a consensus of the regular editors of the page says that the article is comprehensive, then it must be. FAC's entire purpose is to try to get a larger perspective on whether the article meets the appropriate policies or guidelines (in other words, consensus can change). I do think that the RCC page suffers sometimes because most of its editors have a very strong POV. That is understandable; people usually work on topics they are passionate about (either for or against). I fully acknowledge (and praise) that they are trying to make the article as NPOV as possible, but when you hold a strong POV sometimes it is hard to recognize where neutral actually is. That is why processes like FAC, GAN, and PR are essential, because then you can get (hopefully) the opinions of people who don't hold a strong POV on the topic. I would encourage you to post at WT:FAC to see what the consensus is for how to review an article - are NPOV and comprehensiveness concerns off-limits?  Or perhaps it would be useful to post at WT:NPOV to see whether there is consensus for your view that NPOV is decided solely by consensus.  Please let me know if you initiate a discussion, as I would like to participate.    	32340

Sadly, even Pevsner's heirs gave this mediocre architecture only a hurried,cursory glance and right up Missing two important things (one a real buttress and some fenestration indicating 16th/17th century original work and I suspect some 1st generation English Palladianism too. It is clear to anyone with any practical knowledge of building and structural engineering that those pilasters (best word I can think of for them) are not buttresses - they are a decorative feature. They are not high enough to be buttresses; they do not protrude enough and they are in the wrong place for a strain to be occurring - especially just 20 years after the facade was originally completed. They are clearly meant to complement the portico - which they do quite well. There is some quite fascinating interesting architecture here, and I fail to see why it can't be mentioned because some people never bothered (or were deterred) from looking for it.       == Architect ==  In hopes of identifying an architect I checked Colvin: no listing for Tracy Park. \"	32364

0	==A reference of Jesus' cloak ==  Quote from the insight book:  The color of the cloak with which Jesus Christ was clothed on the day of his execution has caused some persons to argue that a discrepancy exists in the Bible record with reference to this garment. Matthew said that the soldiers “draped him with a scarlet cloak” (Mt 27:28), while Mark and John say that it was purple. (Mr 15:17; Joh 19:2) However, instead of being a discrepancy, such a variation in describing the garment’s color merely gives evidence of the individuality of the Gospel writers and the fact that they were not in collusion. Matthew described the cloak as it appeared to him, that is, according to his evaluation of color, and he emphasized the garment’s red hue. John and Mark subdued the red tint, calling it purple. “Purple” can be applied to any color having components of both blue and red. So, Mark and John agree with Matthew that the garment was red to some extent. Of course, background and light reflection could have given it different casts. A body of water varies in color at different times, depending upon the particular color of the sky and the reflection of light at a given time. So, when such factors are considered, it is seen that the Gospel writers were not in conflict in describing the color of the cloak that mocking Roman soldiers clothed Christ with on the last day of his human life.	32370

0	\"  == Some tips for you! ==  Hi , I thought I'd drop a few notes on your talk page with some help on writing articles o)  First of all, it may be best for you to do a bit of reading, starting with the Wikipedia manual of style, which will give you a lot of information about how Wikipedia prefers its articles to be written.  It's not as hard to follow as it might look; quite a bit of the information there probably won't be vital for you at first.  Second, I recommend you make a user sandbox - which is just an area you can use to practise in, and to make notes in, and to get things ready in.  If you click this red link: , that will let you create that page (it gives you an edit window to start work in).  Anything, anywhere, on the help and information pages which gives you an example, try it out in your sandbox until you're familiar with it.  For your article, the next thing you want to do is start collecting as much information as you can about it.  Google searches (particularly in Books and Scholar) will be your best friend for this!  Once you've found the information, the next most important thing is to start writing up each fact in your own words (very important, this), and make a note at the same time of exactly where that information came from.  Build in the references as you go along; I'm going to copy in, down below this, a whole heap of help on doing references, which was produced by one of our best teachers ().  Here's another place that you'll find incredibly useful - citation templates which you can copy and paste into your sandbox, between  tags; you just fill in the blanks from your sources into the template, and you'll end up with nicely formatted inline citations o)  It all helps.  Remember to add a references section to your sandbox (make a new line, and put ==References== on it, and type {{reflist}} on the next line, so that you can see how your citations look as you do them.  Remember to save your page often! You don't want to lose your work.  Hopefully this will give you a good start and make life easier for you.   …  ==How references work==  === Simple references ===  These require two parts;  :a)  Chzz is 98 years old. \"\"The book of Chzz\"\", Aardvark Books, 2009.

I apologize if I posted it elsewhere in the wrong pace, or without a signature. I see that Lucky 6.9's user page now says only \"\"Vacation time...\"\" and displays a stress meter.  His user talk page says \"\"Wikistress is building. I, therefore, have left the building for a brief time.\"\" I see no  acknowledgment that he realizes that he lost his temper.  This in your inference.  But even were that true, and despite his apology to me, and his promise not to delete my posts (without addressing what he'll do to the posts of others), he has shown himself temperamentally unsuited to administrate.  It's quite likely to happen again.  I respect your view that  \"\"I think that would be a mistake on our part that would be comparable to his mistake in losing his temper.\"\"  However, I disagree.

0	\"  == Capitalisation of waterways features ==  Hi. Can you please point me to the WP:MOS page that says all individual bridges, tunnels, locks, etc must be described in lower case? As far as I am concerned, Basingstoke Canal and Foxton Locks are proper nouns and should be capitalised as such. It is correct to talk about \"\"the locks at Foxton\"\", and \"\"the canal in Basingstoke\"\", but using mixed capitalisation is misleading: Foxton locks suggests a type of lock known as 'Foxton'.  You could not correctly say a Bath deep lock, unless there was more than one of them: one would write 'the Bath Deep Lock. There is only one \"\"Bath Deep Lock\"\" so \"\"Bath deep lock\"\" is not an appropriate nomenclature, however Bath chair and Bath bun describe generic items and should not be capitalised.

0	Request to unblock    Hey Hersfold, myself and other editors were discussing random things on the RuneScape Wiki IRC channel when somehow the conversation turned to User:Matthew2602 wondering if he could be unblocked here. I've known this user for quite some time now, and can vouch for him in saying that he is not a sockpuppet of that user, who neither him nor myself have heard of before his blocking. I think that it is safe to assume that the IP that both Matthew2602 and the sockpuppeteer was dynamic, and used by multiple users. Perhaps other users were also unjustly blocked during that case; who knows.  Once upon a time, I woke up one morning in July two years ago, only to find that I was blocked from editing on the only wiki that I was active on at the time, mylegonetwork.wikia.com. That wiki had about 20 active users then, and upon some very quick investigation it seemed that I had been caught up in the autoblock of a user who was blocked for one day for some minor policy violation. Anyways, I got an admin to unblock me and went on my merry way. A few hours later, when talking with him and other users on the IRC, I found out that he lives in the southern United States. I live in Alberta, Canada. We were both using the same IP. Beyond my nice little story, I've known User:Matthew2602 for months. I know that he is a good user with only good faith intentions, and I also know that he would like to be able to edit here again. It would be nice if he could be unblocked without large quantities of bureaucratic pointlessness, but that can happen if needed.  Thanks,     	32514

So, I defended myself that this is directly related to the article and its POV. Then, I was told, that somehow paraphrasing the argument used to push POV is somehow an \"\"attack\"\" on the editors!! And that I \"\"misattributed\"\" them. Fine, I'll deal with that later. Okay, so let me get this straight. People push a POV on an article. They use specific arguments to justify pushing their POV (the endless bickering over \"\"scientific consensus\"\", \"\"scientific community\"\", \"\"facts\"\", \"\"who is a scientist\"\", just read the last 3 years' discussion pages). I come onto this discussion page, and I point out how pathetic their arguments used to push their POV are. When I do this, I am told I am \"\"not addressing the article to improve it\"\", and that I'm \"\"attacking the editors\"\" (!!) and that if I continue to do this, I will be banned. Whatever. Nightscream said: \"\"I made none of the \"\"arguments\"\" you attributed to me, nor do I recall MastCell doing so either.\"\" But you said: \"\"It indicates that it is referring exclusively to those who follow the Scientific Method, and not any ol' Tom, Dick and Harry with a contrary opinion and a webpage.\"\" It does not take a ph.d. to figure out that by \"\"any ol' Tom, Dick, and Harry with a contrary opinion and a webpage\"\" you mean Duesberg, Perth, David Crowe, AIDS Wiki, and Virusmyth, and all the people associated with them. Hence, by your own words, you are saying that all these people, the \"\"Tom, Dick, and Harry\"\"'s, are not following the \"\"scientific method\"\" and are thus not part of your \"\"scientific community\"\". And this is my point. You DEFINE anyone who rejects the hypothesis as necessarily not following scientific method, hence not a member of the scientific community, then claim there's 100% or near 100% agreement in the scientific community that HIV causes AIDS. It's a completely circular argument.   \"	32531
0	\"  == Islamic Science ==  There's been some discussion previously of the need for an article on the History of Islamic Science.  At present there is a small section of that sort in the article on Islamic Science.  There's a real potential for tension there because two different groups are interested in the topic of Islamic Science, and these two groups define it in very different ways. I am concerned that the different assumptions of these two groups may lead to unnecessary conflict, which can be avoided by dividing the present article in two.  * The article \"\"Islamic science\"\" seems to have been founded by advocates of a modern intellectual movement called \"\"Islamic science,\"\" which seeks to establish the practice of science within a particular set of traditional Islamic religious norms. Thus the article defines \"\"Islamic science [as] science in the context of traditional religious ideas of Islam, including its ethics and philosophy. A Muslim engaged in this field is called a Muslim scientist. This is not the same as science as conducted by Muslims in the secular context\"\" (my emphasis).  * Historians of science, on the other hand, find this definition excessively constraining, since we investigate the ways in which scholars within the Islamic world developed scientific ideas through original research and by drawing on and transforming the ideas of their neighbors and predecessors. It really doesn't matter to historians of science whether the particular scientist was Muslim (e.g., al-Khwarizmi), Sabian (e.g., Thabit ibn Qurra), Christian (e.g., Hunain ibn Ishaq), or Jewish (e.g., Hasdai ibn Shaprut), whether he advocated strict adherence to Muslim traditions (e.g. al-Ghazzali) or was critical of tradition and open to the ideas of foreign philosophers (e.g. Averroës), or whether he worked in a religious or secular context. If he studied natural phenomena and worked within the Islamic world, his work fits the historians' broader definition of Islamic science.  These contradictory expectations are likely to lead to conflict in two or more different ways:  * When historians wish to discuss scholars who don't follow traditional Islamic religious norms, while advocates of the modern movement would wish to delete these from the discussion.   * When advocates of the modern Islamic science movement wish to discuss those modern scholars who contribute to the development of that movement, while historians would wish to delete them as not relevant to the historical development of science in Islamic cultures.   Rather than go this unhappy route, I propose an amicable divorce, removing the section on the History of Islamic Science (perhaps renamed History of Science in Islam) and making it a separate article under the History of Science portal, and leaving the remaining article on Islamic Science as part of the series of articles on Islam.  \"	32534

0	The location of Suleyman Shah's tomb is a sovereign territory of Turkey according to France-Turkey 1921 Agreement. Syria obeyed and still obeys that agreement, and since 1921 every sovereignty symbols (Flags, Soldiers, etc.) of Turkey appeared on that territory. When Syria-Turkey border is drawn in 1921, the border separated some villages into two. The naming of most of these villages currently are like that: the part of the villages in Turkey's side is named in Turkish. The parts of the villages in Syria's side is named as the Arabic of the Turkish name or the original Turkish name was protected but with Arabic spelling. This is valid for the new place of the tomb as well: Turkish Eşme (Esme) is in Turkey's side, Syrian Ashma is in Syrian side. Turkey transferred sovereignity of 10000 m2=0.01 km2 territory together with the tomb in Qaraqozak inside another place within Syria (i.e., Syrian Ashma; 200 m from Turkey-Syria border). The Turkish flag is raised in Ashma (200 m from the Turkey-Syria border). The corpses of Suleyman Shah is temporaly in Turkey. When the grave and tomb in Ashma is finished, the corpse of Suleyman Shah will be transferred to Ashma. Hence, sovereign territory was exclave of Turkey, now it is juxtapositioned to Turkey. :* The current change of Suleyman Shah's tomb is not the first change of the sovereign territory within Syria. Due to several reasons (new dams affecting the tomb etc.), sovereign territory of Turkey within Syria was changed earlier many times: 1. From original place to the Caber Castle. 2. From Caber Castle to Qaraqozak village. 3. From Qaraqozak village to Ashma. In all of these changes, sovereignity of Turkey was protected. i.e. Only Turkish flag, Turkish soldiers can be located in that 0.01 km2 territory.   :* In http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Syrian_Civil_War_detailed_map#Ashma , there must be a symbol of tomb must be put. And, Ashma must be indicated as Turkey's territory.    	32620

0	::There are two interpretations . Traditional Catholics consider non-Catholics as protestants. Historians consider Christian groups that historicaly protested or antagonized the Catholic Church as protestant, these are typically Lutherans and affiliates. Are the Greek ,Russian and Coptic Orthodox Churches protestant?They have only been geographically separated and developed that way . They maintain many sacraments seen in the Catholic Church. Also Christian coalitions have core requirements like acceptance of the Divinity of Jesus as the Son of God, Holy Trinity, Ressurection and Salvation through grace, personal relation to J.C. etc. Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists, etc, don't accept all of these. Even the Catholic Church accepts (I believe) certain groups as Christian even if they don't recognize the Pope as long as the fulfill these Christian requirements.

0	\"  == Wikimedia blog post ==  Hello, everyone.  Trying to be as polite and good faithy as possible here this morning.  I hope I won't be smited for pointing something out again.  The current Wikimedia Foundation blog post is Wikipedia for Schools Project.  The blog talks about how Wikipedia for Schools was born out of SOS Children.  It's a great project, providing underprivileged kids in the Third World with curated, age-appropriate content from Wikipedia.  But when you go to see who wrote the Wikipedia articles about the organization and the program, one can see the all too familiar pattern of editorial dominance by conflict-of-interest accounts.  Two days ago, a big chunk of content was added to SOS Children's Villages UK by .  Rainbow Wilcox happens to be Website Content Editor at SOS Children.  No disclosure by RWilcox11, so if that is indeed Ms. Wilcox, the edits are in violation of the Wikimedia Foundation's Terms of Use of this site.  Similarly, on Monday (the day the new Terms of Use went into effect),  was working on the article.  Rory Hughes Social Media Marketer for SOS Children.  In a bit of contrast,  identifies himself on his Talk page as follows, \"\"I work for an international children's charity called SOS Children\"\", so we can assume this is Jamie Goodland who received \"\"special thanks\"\" in the WMF blog post.  Likewise,  identifies on his User page, \"\"I am entirely responsible for the technical work on the 2007 Schools Wikipedia Selection. This work was funded by SOS Children UK (part of the world's largest orphan charity).\"\"  And  identifies (as Andrew Cates) on his User page with, \"\"I also worked from 2004-2013 (part time as CEO) for the charity SOS Children.\"\"  Might I make a recommendation?  Now that the new Terms of Use is coming up on its first week of implementation, maybe someone from the Wikimedia blog staff could make it a point, that whenever they are featuring a person or an organization that has a relevant Wikipedia article, that part of the blogger's responsibility is to reach out to any potentially conflicted editors representing the blog subject, to ask them to self-identify per the new Terms of Use, so that the Wikimedia blog is not inadvertently showcasing violators of the Terms of Use of the Foundation's project.  To do my part, I will be happy to reach out now to Users RWilcox11 and Rory.soschildren, to let them know of this conversation.  (So, it would be nice if it isn't deleted or hatted.) -   \"	32861

0	Dear Connolley, I will try not to shout, but you are making me very irate. There are two articles, both dealing with the problems caused by energy supply. It still is a no brainer that this article must link to the other (and vica versa) I didn't write the peak oil aricle, I'm not trying to defend it as such I just created a quick summary using the facts there and put a link to it. If the facts I've written are wrong then you clearly ought first to make changes to the peak oil article where there are some who can argue the toss with you. If however you dispute the facts, then again you ought to check the peak oil article and make sure that it adequately notes contrary points of view (if you can source them) - but that does not in itself negate the need for the link. But on your specific point - its a bit rich having someone complain about peak oil which has a proven record of making at least some verifiable predictions within a few years when Global warming is still at the stage of a 3:1 range between lowest and highest predictions!   	32871

0	== Editing ==  Edits on wiki improve by evolution: only the best survives. They become best by change after change after change. I find I make two kinds of edits. Ones which add content, and ones which improve language. I fancy I am quite good at writing smooth prose, but very often it is not possible to do this immediately. If I have a fact to insert or point to make, the primary thing is to make or insert it. Then someone else can smooth it along, or i may do so myself when I have more time, or after leaving the piece and re-reading it. It can be quite difficult to write good prose in one go, because you do not spot your mistakes. As to our last exchange in Severus Snape, yes I agree, I put in a clumsy statement, but I was trying to express a particular point. You improved the flow, but slightly altered my point. I changed it again, back a little to my original intention, though you also added something. Cheers. 	33048

I think you were encountering a situation where the NRHP name in our LA list was a red-link and was different than the name of a pre-existing article on the site, and you handled it correctly by revising our list to keep showing the NRHP name (as it is a list of NRHPs) while wikilinking to the pre-existing article.  And you added the NRHP infobox, keeping the NRHP name there (as it should be).  Further, I edited the article intro to mention the alternative name.  And further, i created a redirect at the NRHP name for the site.  I think we talked about how to do redirects a while back....  It would have been similar if the problem had been we had created a new NRHP article already, before finding the pre-existing one.  Then I would have supported merging our material into the older article, and converting our new article into a redirect to the older one.  That gets to the same result as above.    In mergers, I do think it is courteous to merge the newer article into the older one, so that the older history of edits stays with the article.  Even if the newer article name is better, because the merged article can be moved with its entire long history to the newer name, after.  Anyhow i think you handled it right.

0	\"   ==Edit war==  Some notes for those who fear the truth: *A book by fr. Gino Conti was wiped out for the second time. *Another censorship (fr. Pezzi dismissed by Comboni missionaries). Pezzi admitted it in a public interview, whose reference was already in the article. Fr. Pezzi, with Kiko and Carmen, is in the main equipe of the Way; with Kiko and Carmen signs letters to the Pope (cfr. letter of 17 Jan 2006), etc. *The Statute is not an approval. The Statute is a temporary (up to June 2007) guideline. The Statute is an incomplete guideline because it often refers to an unpublished Catechetical Directory (cf. Statute articles 11, 19, 28§2, etc). *The most famous papal pronouncement about the Way is on a letter to mgr. Cordes on August 1990 (letter addressed to Cordes, not to Kiko), where he says \"\"I acknowledge the Way\"\" but these words are preceded by \"\"having seen the documentation you sent me, welcoming the request address to me\"\". *The Statute was given by Pontifical Council for the Laity, not by John Paul II. Also, in the days following publication of the Statute, John Paul II did not mention in his Angelus and speeches. His first mention will come months after. Popes can change their mind about the Way. *Popes can change their mind, if the Way doesn't obey to the Pope. Most recent documents show liturgy issues up to end of 2005. *There are some serious concerns. Discussions about the Way are about heresies, obedience, liturgy... Only Roman Catholic hierarchy has the right to correct and guide the Way. *\"\"Factoid\"\" about st. Pius from Pietrelcina is actually documented by fr. Enrico Zoffoli, in a book and public letters to some Italian Cardinals and Bishops. In the worst case, it's realistic that st. Pius, who was confessor for people from lots of countries (including U.S. people from nearest NATO base), knew something about Kiko movement in Madrid between 1964 and 1967. *The temporary Statute was artificially elevated to highest \"\"We're Approved\"\" Neocatechumenal propaganda. *Gennarini, the chief of the Way in the U.S., did actually give a \"\"Neocatechumenal spin\"\" interpretation, documented also by Jimmi Akin. *Kiko, Carmen and Pezzi were thanking for \"\"granting a period of two years\"\", but Benedict XVI decisions about that \"\"widespread manner\"\" were timed «not exceeding two years». That is: Benedict XVI wants to solve quickly the problem, but Kiko, Carmen and Pezzi do not. *\"\"Note: the echoes were never put in place of the homily, or meant to sound like one\"\": this valuable sentence tries to \"\"explain\"\" in Neocatechumenalspeak the \"\"decision of the Holy Father\"\" to require homily only from deacons and priests. *On the exchange of peace, permission is granted to the Neocatechumenal Way to continue «giving peace as done in the Early Church» - everyone can verify that the original text of Arinze's letter does not contain such words. Why do Neocatechumenals need a distort and falsified citation? Correct text was: «on the exchange of peace, permission is granted to the Neocatechumenal Way to continue using the indult already granted, pending further instructions» (please note: indult - that is: special permission - and pending further instructions - that is: the indult is temporary). *The \"\"NPOV\"\" tag was the last resort of some Neocatechumenal people fearing the truth. Please stop this ugly \"\"edit war\"\". Wiping out documented sources won't change the facts.   \"	33218

0	== Wikipedia Ambassador Program is looking for Campus Ambassadors in Houston ==  Hi!  I'm leaving you this message because you are listed as a Wikipedian connected with the University of Houston.  The Wikipedia Ambassador Program is currently looking for Campus Ambassadors to help with Wikipedia assignments at another Houston school, which will be participating in the Public Policy Initiative for the Spring 2011 semester.  The role of Campus Ambassadors will be to provide face-to-face training and support for students on Wikipedia-related skills (how to edit articles, how to add references, etc.). This includes doing in-class presentations, running workshops and labs, possibly holding office hours, and in general providing in-person mentorship for students.  Prior Wikipedia skills are not required for the role, as training will be provided for all Campus Ambassadors (although, of course, being an experienced editor is a plus).  If you live in Houston and you are interested in being a Wikipedia Campus Ambassador, or know someone else from the area who might be, please email me or leave a message on my talk page.  	33301

But thought will need to go into this to see how best to advertise it. ::::The \"\"lack of interest\"\" idea was literally just an idea. The thrust of this 'proposal' is that, by causing the \"\"loudmouths\"\" (such as me!) to shut up after presenting their case, it would be easier for other parties to discuss the salient points of the issue. In my experience, important points get \"\"lost\"\" in the debate as one side or the other will (sometimes deliberately) drown them out with side-issues. This is why the role of overseer is crucial. The overseer would be required to look out for people doing this and rein them in. In that environment a consensus has a better chance. However, we must have a mechanism by which resolution can be achieved without consensus (in a similar way to ArbCom). Hence, the idea would require an \"\"oversight committee\"\" (to be dubbed \"\"OverCom\"\", no doubt) that would make a \"\"final resort\"\" decision. I suspect that this would usually be in favour of one side or the other, but they should perhaps have the option of saying \"\"neither is right\"\" (or both, to some extent). ::::Just had a thought that may be worth considering.

0	Saying that Largoplazo only nominated the article for deletion because of deletionist tendencies is hardly uncivil and is entirely valid considering that he just nominated the article for deletion again, even AFTER I added more sources to it.  He's clearly aiming to take advantage of the fact that I can't currently edit the Articles for deletion page to defend the article, which is patently childish and uncivil behavior.  For example, if I were capable of editing the Articles for deletion page that he just created, I would note that the film has been covered in all sorts of notable sources, like:  http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b78523a6f - British Film Institute  http://www.villagevoice.com/film/tuli-kupferberg-is-god-and-a-shoulda-been-cult-hit-finally-gets-its-ny-premiere-6429111 - The Village Voice  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/movies/voulez-vous-coucher-avec-god/8d6kgwzl5h7h - Microsoft  https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/voulez-vous-coucher-avec-god/id645402033 - iTunes  https://www.iffr.com/en/films/voulez-vous-coucher-avec-god/ - International Film Festival Rotterdam  https://books.google.com/books?id=1GCX5KQ0JXoC&pg;=PT190&dq;=%22Voulez-vous+coucher+avec+God%22&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0CDYQ6AEwBWoVChMI_qekx_jixwIViJMeCh0VmglK#v=onepage&q;=%22Voulez-vous%20coucher%20avec%20God%22&f;=false - Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema  ...to name just a few.  I would also point out that several notable people were involved with the film, like the VERY notable Tuli Kupferberg, who stars in it.  But I can't edit the page because I'm blocked right now, and he nominated the article for deletion again only after you blocked me - because he wanted to make sure I couldn't edit the Articles for deletion page.

Predating all that is related below, the Pandava ancestors of Janjuas were known historically for the great Mahabharata war in which Arjuna and his brothers were victorious after huge losses on both sides.  \"\"The Janjua Rajputs possess a proud Martial reputation and rank very highly as the aristocracy of the Salt Range. Their pride in their ancestry is renowned and are always addressed by their ancestral title of Raja.\"\" (Rawalpindi District Gazetteer Robertson, reprint 2001, Lahore, p105)  \"\"Their (Janjuas) exploits and reputation has earned them the regard as the most Valiant Kshatriyas (warlords) in the Punjab.\"\" (History of Mediaeval Hindu India by Chintaman Vinayak Vaidya, Cosmo Publ. 1979, p129) \"\"The tribal system of loyalty to the clan is still adhered, and they tend to only align with other tribes of equally high social rank and reputation.\"\" (The Aftermath of Partition in South Asia Gyanes Kudaisya, London 2000, p207) “The great Janjua tribe have retained their pride of lineage and their Rájput title, and can be ranked as Míán Sáhu or first class Rájpúts...physically well-looking, with fine hands and feet; much given to military service, especially in the cavalry;...poor agriculturists, with great pride of race and are always addressed as Raja” (Panjab Castes - Sir Denzil Ibbetson, reprint Delhi 2002, p149, p154) \"\"The Janjua are famed as a restless and warlike Muslim Rājput tribe.\"\" (Imperial Gazetteer of Kashmir and Jammu, Sang e Meel, reprint 2002, p9, p34) and are \"\"doubtless pure Rājputs\"\".(Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 14, p152) & (The Indian Village Community by Baden Henry Baden-Powell, Adamant Media Corp. 2005, p97) The Janjuas Rajputs have been recognised in Punjabi history as a 'Martial clan' and the British also viewed them as excellent soldiers and distinguished them from other tribes as\"\"other tribes no way superior to them in courage or military skill\"\". ('Punjab Chiefs' L.H.Griffin, 1909 Lahore, p215-7}. . The ancestors of the Janjuas Rajputs , the last dynasty of the Janjua Shahis, were mentioned by Albiruni..\"\"as noble men of noble bearings...who always did what they said\"\". Al-Biruni, despite living under Sultan Mahmud's grace, praises the house of Jayapala Janjua (10th Century AD): \"\"We must say that in all their grandeur, they never slackened in the ardent desire of doing that which is good and right, that they were men of noble sentiment and noble bearing.\"\" Kalhana (13th Century AD) writes of the Janjua Shahis: \"\"Where is the Shahi dynasty with its ministers, its kings, and its great grandeur? ... The very name of the splendor of Shahi kings has vanished. What is not seen in dream, what even our imagination cannot conceive, that dynasty accomplished with ease\"\".  The Tarikh-e-Alfi of the Ghorids (13th Century AD) mentions the rebellious behaviour of [1]Raja (Ajmal) Mal (est. d. 1230 AD) (son of Raja Dhrupat Dev of Mathura) towards the Delhi Sultanate. It records that a \"\"Rai Mal\"\" of the mountains between Lahore and Kabul excited a rebellion against them and intercepted communications between Lahore and Ghazni. There is still today remnants of an ancient fort in Malot, Chakwal which was initially built by the Shahis and later rebuilt by Raja Mal Janjua. It is also inscribed that the last Hindu Shahi emperor Raja Mal embraced Islam at this place. Raja Mal was also the first ruler to begin the mining of salt in the Salt Ranges of Kallar Kahar and in the Khewra Salt Mines of Punjab which is currently the world's second largest salt mine. Many prominent Muslim tribes of Potohar Plateau in Pakistan trace their lineage back to the Janjuas through the five princes of the House of Raja Mal Janjua (13th Century AD). The five princes were: Raja Bhir Raja Jodh (est. d. 1259 AD) (ancestor of Chakri/Bajwala / Darapur Janjuas) Raja Kala Raja Tanoli Raja Khakha Jodh and Bhir were born of a Gakhar Rani while Kala, Khakha and Tanoli were born of another Rajput Rani. ('Journal of Central Asia', Vol.XIII, no.1, 1990 p79). According to Lepel H.

0	**No worries, it's understandable considering that your changes take some time to do. I don't know if you're Wikignoming because you lack the time or resources to expand articles or if it's just something you prefer to do, but there's certainly other stuff that you can be profitably be doing. Ship article titles need to have the ship's name in italics or you could focus on improving their categorization, neither of which I tend to remember to do anything about. Adding convert templates to articles is certainly worthwhile, although I'd suggest you limit your preference for always abbreviating everything. For one thing, I like to show the hyphen form of a compound adjective like 15-inch gun, something that abbreviating eliminates. You could ensure that articles written in AmEnglish use American spelling of units and vice versa; just be sure not to change the type of English unless there are strong national connections like RN ships use BritEng or USN ships use AmEng. Articles on non-English speaking navies' ships have no national connection and can be written in either form; just be sure that it's consistent within the article. And if you'd like to write a ship article, I'd be happy to help as I have a pretty large library; so much so that I don't really consider Jane's Fighting Ships as a top tier resource.

I can only assume that the person who made the changes did not read the page carefully. The remaining categories imply that the NATF is simply an American radio drama performance festival and \"\"artists collective\"\".    The festival is not a performance alone, but comprises a professional organization - not a \"\"collective\"\" or amorphous \"\"group\"\" - of audio engineers, sound artists, voice actors, playwrights and producers. Its yearly event, also known as the National Audio Theatre Festival, involves several days of instruction, training, special talks and other discussions on these topics. For example, training in sound mastering, sound production, voice acting.  The Friday night performance is the \"\"cherry on the sundae\"\".   It is one of the only conferences of its type worldwide. Many of the participants do NOT work on the radio at all, but in audio books, film or animation, and likewise, while all the training involves the audio arts, it is not just an \"\"audio drama festival\"\". The upcoming 2011 festival, for example, will be focusing on voice acting in animation.  Several of the categories are rather egregious removals, such as \"\"Audio plays\"\", \"\"radio drama\"\", \"\"sound recording,\"\" \"\"sound technology\"\", and \"\"voice acting\"\", for which NATF is one of the only national training grounds or gathering for professionals... and even as other pages in those categories that are affiliated with NATF or are similarly themed stay in those categories. I therefore have returned most of the categories back.     \"	33824

0	\"I had nearly moved on when I felt completely compelled to comment on this statement \"\"probably better than most clan websites, which tend to be based on long outdated stuff from the 19th century. Then I do not see a problem in using it until a better source can be found. Especially to make amends to the masses of unsourced information that is found on so many of the individual clan articles\"\". I can only interpet this as something is probably better because it is newer?? This makes no sense to me. History is what it is, it should not change for the sake of change. If it was accurate over 600 years ago, it is just as accurate today. Again, if something is true and accurate hundreds or even thousands of years ago, it is not and should not be subject to change because someone decides to re-write it for either personal gain or an agenda. That is exactly what has happened with the origins for many Highland Clans. For any that might be interested, William Skene's and John Murray's collaboration of The Highlanders of Scotland: Their Origin, History and Antiquities is a wonderful and refreshing read. This is more than likely the truest accounting for several of the Highland Clans. It asserts that many of the origin claims put forth in more recent times are attempts to gain a foothold on the Chieftainship, by usurping the rightful lines. You'll find that cadet septs used this technique to basically try to re-write history for their own selfish gain. You'd have to read the book to see how this played out but as I said before, nearly ALL of the Highland Clans being \"\"bastardized\"\" as Norman/Anglo-Horman/Flemish, etc. are really Dalriadan and Pictish mixes. Examples would be Campbell, Cameron, Grant, Davidson, Wallace, etc. I of course have distant YDNA connections to ALL of these surnames, but I know no one wants to hear about that as any sort of evidence. I'll admit not one of these surnames or clans has a pure lineage, but they all have a lineage going back to the Picts and Gaels. I am of that lineage, which is quite rare and continues to be established. The masses are not of that lineage, they are a mix if R1A1, other R1B haplotypes, the I haplotypes, etc. I will be the first to admit there may be hundreds of families, not even related through a shared male ancestor, sharing a surname or Clan. My concern is with the origins only, and the original Chiefly lines. And please don't tell me how we are a mix of so much dna, I am only referring to YDNA, the male lines. I am not talking about MTDNA nor Autosomal. What I don't understand is why when there is so much sourced information out there, some editors choose only to use factually inaccurate \"\"sourced\"\" information. There is substantial \"\"factually accurate\"\" sourced information out there however it is not my intent, to correct these erroneous articles or to present an \"\"opposing view\"\". There is no opposing view, there is either the truth, or their are lies. Either the Celtic version is correct, or the Comyn version is correct, or neither is correct. There can't factually be multiple versions of an origin, it is what it is and there is only one true origin. This is not a contest to see who can provide more recent sources. I would hope wikipedia would want the truth out there, and not contests of who can out edit who, which is what wikipedia appears to be. There, my case is presented to the message and not a specific messenger. Clan Davidson is Celtic, it descended from Celts and it has no connection to the Comyn family. It did not descend from a Comyn male. They came from a very ancient Gaelic ancestor, an ancestor shared by several Highland Clans, before surnames even were in use. One other greatly incorrect update to this site was the battle alleged between the Davidson's and the MacPherson's....this never happened. The battle was between the Clans fighting for the Chief of the Clan Chattan, the battle was fought between the Mackintoshs and the MacPhersons.The MacPhersons were the true chiefly line, but were \"\"out-documented\"\" by the usurping Mackintosh. This is pretty much exactly what is happening here, on this very page. I hope someone else has more time and energy to properly update this page with the correct information and let's bury the lies and factually inaccurate information comprising most of this article. It was originally much more factually accurate, but over the course of time has been corrupted with sourced information that is not also factually accurate.  \"	34013

0	==Some Starčević's sources in his polemic agains Greater Serbian ideology==  Ancient historiography: http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/De_Administrando_Imperio  On Croats .........  But the Croats at that time were dwelling beyond Bavaria, where the Belocroats are now. From them split off a family of five brothers, Kloukas and Lobelos and Kosentzis and Mouchlo and Chrobatos, and two sisters, Touga and Bouga, who came with their folk to Dalmatia and found the Avars in possession of that land. After they had fought one another for some vears, the Croats prevailed and killed some of the Avars and the remainder they compelled to be subject to them. And so from that time this land was possessed by the Croats, and there are still in Croatia some who are of Avar descent and are recognized as Avars. The rest of the Croats stayed over against Francia, and are now called Belocroats, that is, white Croats, and have their own prince ; they are subject to Otto, the great king of Francia, or Saxony, and are unbaptized, and intermarry and are friendly with the Turks. From the Croats who came to Dalmatia a part split off and possessed themselves of Illyricum and Pannonia ; they too had a sovereign prince, who used to maintain friendly contact, though through envoys only, with the prince of Croatia. For a number of years the Croats of Dalmatia also were subject to the Franks, as they had formerly been in their own country ; but the Franks treated them with such brutality that they used to murder Croat infants at the breast and cast them to the dogs. The Croats, unable to endure such treatment from the Franks, revolted from them, and slew those of them whom they had for princes. On this, a large army from Francia marched against them, and after they had fought one another for seven years, at last the Croats managed to prevail and destroyed all the Franks with their leader, who was called Kotzilis. From that time they remained independent and autonomous,.... .................. These baptized Croats will not fight foreign countries outside the borders of their own ; for they received a kind of oracular response and promise from the pope of Rome who in the time of Heraclius, emperor of the Romans, sent priests and baptized them. For after their baptism the Croats made a covenant, confirmed with their own hands and by oaths sure and binding in the name of St. Peter the apostle, that never would they go upon a foreign country and make war on it, but rather would live at peace with all who were willing to do so ; and they received from the same pope of Rome a benediction to this effect, that if any of the pagans should come against the country of these same Croats and bring war upon it, then might the God of the Croats fight for the Croats and protect them, and Peter the disciple of Christ give them victories. ............... Again, Symeon sent another army against prince Zacharias, under Kninos and Himnikos and Itzboklias, and together with them he sent also Tzeeslav. Then Zacharias took fright and fled to Croatia, and the Bulgarians sent a message to the 'zupans' that they should come to them and should receive Tzeeslav for their prince ; and, having tricked them by an oath and brought them out as far as the first village, they instantly bound them, and entered Serbia and took away with them the entire folk, both old and young, and carried them into Bulgaria, though a few escaped away and entered Croatia ; and the country was left deserted. Now, at that time these same Bulgarians under Alogobotour entered Croatia to make war, and there they were all slain by the Croats.   On Serbs ........  But when two brothers succeeded their father in the rule of Serbia, one of them, taking a moiety of the folk, claimed the protection of Heraclius, the emperor of the Romans, and the same emperor Heraclius received him and gave him a place in the province of Thessalonica to settle in, namely Serbia, which from that time has acquired this denomination. 'Serbs' in the tongue of the Romans is the word for 'slaves', whence the colloquial 'serbula' for menial shoes, and 'tzerboulianoi' for those who wear cheap, shoddy footgear. This name the Serbs acquired from their being slaves of the emperor of the Romans. Now, after some time these same Serbs decided to depart to their own homes, and the emperor sent them off. But when they had crossed the river Danube, they changed their minds and sent a request to the emperor Heraclius, through the military governor then governing Belgrade, that he would grant them other land to settle in. And since what is now Serbia and Pagania and the so-called country of the Zachlumi and Terbounia and the country of the Kanalites were under the dominion of the emperor of the Romans, and since these countries had been made desolate by the Avars (for they had expelle	34119

I haven't examined the growth, but yes, gradual growth (as opposed to sudden jumps in size) suggests that the editorial work went on here. So perhaps I was too hasty.  :Here is Graham's page about himself. I now notice that it says at its foot Excerpt from Gallery Press Release, 2008. So it's possible that it copied the press release which itself was a copy of the WP article.  :So maybe I have an \"\"overly critical attitude\"\". But if so, it's an overly critical attitude toward the editing, not Graham's work. (I've seen some of his early work from Beyond Caring and think it's very good; I know little about his other work.)  :Why the apparent concentration on Japan? First, it's hardly a concentration; it's simply the addition of a sourced fact. And, if you're interested, here's how it came about. Having created Category:Photography in Japan, I populated it. Racking my brain for non-Japanese photographers who'd done a significant amount of work in Japan was a pleasant activity for a commuter trip or three; I also emailed a couple of friends more knowledgable about the matter than I am. Graham's name came up, either to one of them or to me. I was certain that he'd done work in Japan so I put this in  in accordance with WP policy, backing up the assertion with a reliable source.   :This was a contribution of time and energy, though admittedly a tiny one. Graham's work seems to have many admirers. I was hoping and expecting that among themselves they'd rebuild the article. I'd be willing to help with this. While not working on Graham's article, I've been working on articles about other photographers.  :So let's turn back the clock to September 2008, before the cuts. Here's a paragraph:  ::Graham was the first photographer to combine the sensibility of contemporary colour photography with classic British social documentary. In 1981/2 he made A1—The Great North Road, a book of 40 colour photographs taken along the length of the British A1 road, which had a transformative effect on the black and white tradition that had dominated British art photography till that point. This work, along with Graham's later photographs of the 1980s -  the colour images of unemployment offices in Beyond Caring (1984-85), and the sectarian marked landscape of Northern Ireland Troubled Land (1984-86) - were pivotal in reinvigorating and expanding this area of photography, by both broadening it's visual language, and questioning our notions of what such photography could say, be, or look like. Photographers like Martin Parr made the switch to colour soon after, and a new school of British Photography evolved with the subsequent colour work of Richard Billingham, Tom Wood, Paul Seawright, Anna Fox, Nick Waplington, etc.  :Let's suppose for a minute that this is legitimate WP text, and not ripped off from somewhere else. Its content is a mixture of the easily verifiable and the arguable. Was he the first photographer to make this combination? Did this one book have a transformative effect? Why \"\"British art photography\"\" (my emphasis)? How were they \"\"pivotal\"\"? This stuff would have to be sourced.

Taphonomy  “The study of how living organisms become fossilized is known as taphonomy.  … From the moment an organism dies, there is a tremendous loss of information as it decays and is trampled, tumbled, and broken before it is buried.  The more of that lost information that we can reconstruct, the more reliable our scientific hypotheses are likely to be.  ….  From the original complete assemblage of living organism, known as a ‘life assemblage” or biocenosis, many events occur that screen out certain organisms, leaving a much smaller death assemblage, or thanatocenosis.  The process of breakup and decay of organism immediately after death is known as necrolysis.   “After a death assemblage accumulates, many other factors operate on the hard parts to break them up and scatter them around, so an even smaller percentage ends up buried for future fossilization.  These processes occur after necrolysis and are known as biostratinomy.  These agents of destruction can be biological, mechanical, or chemical.  “Biological agents are the most important factor in most environments, both marine and terrestrial.  Both predators and scavengers are very active in breaking up shells and bones ….  In summary, the key factor that prevents biological destruction is rapid burial.”  For those organism that are not buried right away:  “Mechanical agents of destruction such as wind, waves, and currents can be very important.  These processes are most effective in shallow waters, where both waves and storm have their highest energies.  … In summary, the shape, density, and thickness of the bone or shell are the most important factors in determining survival under mechanical transport [until burial].”  “After burial a variety of digenetic [chemical] changes in the rock can easily destroy shells.  … In summary, the original composition and the groundwater chemistry are the most important factors in determining whether digenetic changes are likely to alter or dissolve a fossil.”  “Taphonomic research has come a long way since the pioneering studies of the 1960s and 1970s.  Paleontologists can no longer afford to naively take the fossil record at face value, but must always keep in mind the taphonomic “noise” that may obscure the original biological ‘signal’.”  Lagerstatten:  “The processes outlined above account for most fossilization and what we know of the living organism is usually quite incomplete.  However, there are extraordinary fossil deposits around the world that preserve soft tissues and sometimes even skin texture and color patterns. … These are known as Lagerstatten (German for “mother lode”), and they have produced some of the most important fossils known.  … From all these examples, several general trends emerge.  The best fossilization occurs when there is rapid burial and anoxic conditions to prevent scavenging, no reworking currents and little or no digenetic alteration to destroy the fossils.”  The Museum of the Rockies here in Bozeman is the realm of paleontologist Jack Horner.  I have often heard Jack speak, pointing out that the dinosaurs of Montana were almost all killed and buried by catastrophic river floods near the shore of the inland sea that is now Eastern Montana, the Dakotas and related Canadian States.  The bones and the geology both acclaim to that.  Of course, these floods are considered local in extant.  This same theme is echoed on many signs and posters through out the museum.     	34314

0	An alluvial plain is a relatively flat and gently sloping landform found at the base of a range of hills or mountains, formed by the deposition of alluvial soil over a long period of time by a rivers coming from the mountains.  As the hills erode due to weathering and water flow the sediment from the hills is transported to the lower plain. Various creeks will carry the water further to a river, lake, bay, or ocean. As the sediments are deposited during flood conditions in the floodplain of a creek, the elevation of the floodplain will be raised. As this reduces the channel floodwater capacity, the creek will over time seek new, lower paths, forming meanders (a curving sinuous path). The leftover higher locations, typically natural levees at the margins of the flood channel, will themselves be eroded by lateral stream erosion and from local rainfall and possibly wind transport if the climate is arid and does not support soil-holding grasses. These processes over geologic time will form the plain - a region with little relief (local changes in elevation), yet with a constant but small slope.	34354

Little attributed the disease to a lack of oxygen to an infant during \"\"abnormal forms of labor\"\" resulting in a spastic condition. His work on the disease was so groundbreaking that it was first known as Little's Disease. http://cerebralpalsy.org/about-cerebral-palsy/history-and-origin-of-cerebral-palsy/.  === Definition === Cerebral palsy is a disease that effects the brain and nervous system. The disease can be divided into various subsets, including spastic cerebral palsy, dyskinetic cerebral palsy, ataxic cerebral palsy, hypotonic cerebral palsy, and mixed. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001734/  Spastic Cerebral Palsy is the most common form of this disease. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001734/. It is distinguishable from other forms of Cerebral Palsy in that sufferers display stiff, jerky movements, and have hypertonic muscles. http://www.merriam-webster.com/medlineplus/spastic%20cerebral%20palsy This differs from Non-Spastic cerebral palsy, which causes decreased, or fluctuating muscle tone. http://cerebralpalsy.org/about-cerebral-palsy/types/#cm   Spastic Cerebral Palsy can itself be divided into unique categories. * Spastic hemipelegia **Only one side of the body is effected in spastic hemipelgia.  *Spastic dipelgia **2 limbs are effected in Spastic dipelgia.  *Spastic triplegia **3 limbs are effected in Spastic diplegia. *Spastic quadripelgia **All 4 limbs are effected in Spastic quadriplegia.    \"	34586

This is an analysis by Medha Patkar which points out that unconditional release will result only in Sharmila's death. She points out that the call for unconditional release is just another form of brutal treatment but you can read the article yourself http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/government-brutally-dealing-with-irom-sharmila-medha-patkar_1462222.html This is the Indian Express report which points out that she has no real supporters in Manipur Mr Babloo Loitongbam controls many fake NGOs in Manipur and is doing what he can to isolate her http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/irom-sharmila-released-again-refuses-to-go-with-her-supporters-and-breaks-down/99/ This is a reference to the Indian Intelligence Bureau and RAW about Manipuri NGOs working as foreign industrial spies http://www.newindianexpress.com/thesundaystandard/NGOs-Foreign-Funds-Fuel-Terror/2014/06/22/article2292852.ece The original leaked report doesn't have the names of the NGOs or the names of the foreign spies but Mr Babloo Loitongbam outed himself and other Manipuris in this press release http://e-pao.net/GP.asp?src=2..260614.jun14 This is a report in Sharmila's own words voice and video of the abuses she has been facing including http://www.ndtv.com/video/player/left-right-centre/irom-sharmila-on-if-her-iconic-fast-has-been-hijacked/297129  Those are a few to be going on with. There are three trials in total. You don't require original research to work that out. She is being held in Imphal on judicial warrants if there weren't any trials in Imphal then she wouldn't be in prison. The last dates of the trial in Delhi are correct 11 & 12 August 2015 but it is nonsense to claim that there are no trials in Imphal or that it is impossible to find any reference to them. If in doubt use Google.   The SS group has no standing with Sharmila but is also run by Mr Babloo Loitongbam. He comes from a very powerful police family and people suck up to him. If he drops the plans to have sharmila killed then you can campaign for him to get the nobel peace prize. I have no vendetta against anyone. I am just trying to point out the truth and keep my fiancee alive. But this is just wiki and only the lazy believe everything they read here.  	35040

KM can be used for selecting the size of a motor to use in an application.  Kv can be used for selecting the winding to use in the motor. /  It look to me as if the scope is well beyond the original article and if put anywhere - it should be herer.  	35063

This was a terrible edit on your part because not only is it absolute truth that the equations to be solved are not equations for a hyperbola, it is extremely important that the readers be told this fact.  The reason for this is because there is much discussion relating to hyperbolas in the section which is quite likely to mislead the reader into believing that the equations to be solved are equations for a hyperbola.  The fact that you only say, removed contrarian remark, indicates that you were very superficial in your thinking.

While it could be argued that the above is true, I don't think the article should simply state it as fact. It could equally well be argued to be false (eg, a mutant chimpanzee would be a different kind to normal chimpanzees and so could have rights, and a non-mutant chimpanzee would not have the linguistic abilities to contribute to wikipedia or the moral concepts to be a moral being, however intelligent).

This is known as a \"\"cut-and-paste move\"\", and it is undesirable because it splits the page history, which is legally required for attribution.  Instead, the software used by Wikipedia has a feature that allows pages to be moved to a new title together with their edit history. In most cases, once your account is four days old and has ten edits, you should be able to move an article yourself using the \"\"Move\"\" tab at the top of the page (the tab may be hidden in a dropdown menu for you). This both preserves the page history intact and automatically creates a redirect from the old title to the new.

0	\" ::It happened so long ago and the situation was SO complex that I think no one really remembers completely correctly what happened. As far as I remember, it went something like this: the owner of Chernomorets Burgas bought Conegliano German (a team from a village next to Sofia) and for various reasons (mainly to get the Burgas team into a higher division without going through the proper means of actually gaining promotion - which is the same as what happened when Akademik Sofia swapped divisions with Vihar Gorublyane, actually, as well as a bunch of other teams such as Pirin Blagoevgrad) merged the two teams, which ended up being called \"\"Chernomorets Burgas (Burgas)\"\" in Group B and \"\"Chernomorets Burgas (Sofia)\"\" in Group A. Then a whole bunch of other stuff happened at the same time such as Burgas municipality founding their OWN team (which they called \"\"Chernomorets (Burgas)\"\" - note the punctuation in all three cases); then a bunch of business deals went down whereby Neftohimik Burgas (which had since been renamed \"\"Naftex\"\") got merged with Pomorie, then that team got merged with one of the Chernomorets'es, then the other Chernomorets remained as the \"\"official\"\" Chernomorets, but still there was some dispute over players/grounds/finances...then that eventually merged with the first chernomorets; then the Sofia Chernomorets went back to being Conegliano German, then the Neftohimik fans formed a fans' club Neftohimik which began at the lowest level and... in short - before 2000 there was a Neftohimik and a Chernomorets in Burgas, and after 2010 there is a Neftohimik and a Chernomorets in Burgas. And between 2000 & 2010 a whole bunch of weird&random; stuff happened that I just don't know how to coherently explain. I reckon they can simply be mentioned in the Chernomorets Burgas and Neftochimic Burgas 1986 articles as something along the lines of: \"\"various business dealings led to the formation and dissolution of several clubs including \"\"Ch.B.B\"\", \"\"Ch.B.S.\"\" and \"\"Ch(B.)\"\" and, ultimately, led to the current state of the team\"\". Or something equally inane. I dont know...

It confuses the term mesirat nefesh citing both a literal meaning (dieing for the faith) and a figurative one (trying really hard).  Also it misses many of the most important aspect of the law (The biblical references (Deut. 6:5), (Leviticus 22:32); a person is not punishable for sins committed under duress even if it was still forbidden).  I started rewriting it and found that the only way to present it was in context of Pikuach nefesh.

Undoing another editor's work—whether in whole or in part, whether involving the same or different material each time—counts as a revert.

0	\"  Leejc is absolutely right. He did a better job expressing what I tried to say back in June, 2007. But while I agree with his final conclusion, it isn't quite the right argument to use, that \"\"we must assume the worst,\"\" to get it. So I thought I would try once again to explain how the different wordings of this problem, that seem to say the same thing, can lead to different solutions.  The ultimate cause of confusion is the math-specific definition of the term \"\"event.\"\" When a random experiment produces a result, that result is not called an \"\"event,\"\" it is an \"\"occurrence.\"\" \"\"Event\"\" is defined to be the subset of all possible occurrences that have some defining common property. So if I flip a coin a hundred times, there are only two possible events: \"\"heads\"\" and \"\"tails.\"\" There will most likely be about fifty occurrences of each event; and each occurrence will fit into only one event.  If I draw a card from a standard deck of playing cards, there are lots of possible events and/or occurrences. Some of them overlap. They include \"\"black card,\"\" \"\"spade,\"\" \"\"honor card (TJQKA),\"\" \"\"Ace,\"\" and \"\"Ace of Spades.\"\" The occurrence \"\"black card\"\" can be in the event \"\"spade\"\" or \"\"club\"\" as well. Note that an occurrence can fit into other events, but not vice versa. An occurrence of \"\"spade\"\" is also an occurrence of \"\"black card,\"\" but the event \"\"spade\"\" is most definitely not the event \"\"black card.\"\" Since determining probabilities involves counting the number of elements in events, the difference can be crucial when less specific observations are applied.  There is a famous problem that isolates this difference between an occurrence and an event. It is called Bertrand's Box Paradox Suppose you have three indistinguishable boxes, each with two indistinguishable drawers. Inside each drawer is a coin. Box #1 has two gold coins, Box #2 has two bronze coins (I can't resist the temptation to use the initials B and G), and Box #3 has one of each. You pick a box at random, and open a drawer at random. If the coin is gold, what are the odds that the coin in the box's other drawer is also gold (i.e., that it is Box #1)?  The first issue here, common to story problems, is that this problem describes an occurrence, not an event. We must extrapolate what the possible outcomes of the actions are, to define the event (the set of possible occurrences) that defines the conditional probability.  The incorrect approach to Bertrand's Box Paradox is to say that you narrowed the identity of the box to two possibilities, Box #1 and Box #3. That the \"\"event\"\" matches the observation \"\"the box has at least one gold coin.\"\" This is wrong because there are other ways to describe occurrences in that event. If you pick box #3, then no matter which drawer you open, the occurrence is in the event \"\"the box has at least one gold coin.\"\"  The correct approach is to define the event as the set of all possible occurrences where you open a drawer with a gold coin. Every possible occurrence that is consistent with the problem description is in this event (remember, it's a set), and every possible element of this event is consistent with the problem description. Both of those conditions have to be true for the event set we extrapolate as the condition. This set has three elements, not two. In two of those three possible occurrences, the box's other coin is gold. The correct answer is 2/3.  I have seen a variation of Bertrand's Box Paradox used to represent the Boy or Girl Paradox. You are the organizer of a neighborhood swim meet. During the meet, you get a phone call from Mr. Smith, who is delayed and can't pick up his children after the meet. He says \"\"Tell my two kids to go home with a neighbor. Their names are Sarah and...\"\" and the phone connection goes dead. There are four families of two children in the meet, and they conveniently include the four possibilities BB, BG, GB, and GG. What are the odds that Mr. Smith has two daughters?  This occurrence can be described as \"\"a two-child family includes at least one girl.\"\" But not the event you need to use as the condition. Mr. Smith could have mentioned a boy's name first; and if that boy had a sister, that occurrence would have been an element of the set \"\"a two-child family includes at least one girl.\"\" So that event fails one of the two criteria. You get the answer 1/3 by erroneously using this event.  The correct event is just that Mr. Smith mentioned that he had a daughter, and compares to \"\"you opened a drawer with a gold coin\"\" in the Box Paradox. You can count four possible occurrences of that event. In two of those four, representing a single family, Sarah has a sister. The correct answer is 2/4, or 1/2.  If a conditional probability question describes an occurrence, and not an event, care needs to be taken whe	35638

From what I can see the relevant text is here:  ::::Linking to copyrighted works ::::\"\"External sites can possibly violate copyright. Linking to copyrighted works is usually not a problem, as long as you have made a reasonable effort to determine that the page in question is not violating someone else's copyright. If it is, please do not link to the page. Knowingly and intentionally directing others to a site that violates copyright has been considered a form of contributory infringement in the United States (Intellectual Reserve v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry). Also, linking to a page that illegally distributes someone else's work sheds a bad light on us. If the site in question is making fair use of the material, linking is fine.\"\" ::::From what I can tell, I think that the sites that are hosting the BDI-I and BDI-II are violating copyright. Most of them don't say that they have permission to use the instrument, they don't cite the original paper, and in the licence when you buy a copy it explicitly says not to make electronic copies. Now each of these separate users may have made a licence deal with Harcourt individually, but it seems unlikely. A lot of the google hits that come up are appendices and lecture notes from university projects; I don't think there is an exemption for educational use, but then university psychology departments often buy a \"\"portfolio\"\" of test copyrights for limited use. This would not normally extend to use on the web however. In terms of next steps, I actually think this is one of the rare occasions where a consensus is not the way to go, but rather we could list the issue at WP:CP? ::::If it's an issue of helping depressed people, I'm not sure having people just fill out the form will do them much good.

0	\"  ==Your contributed article, Carlos Vives discography==  Hello, I notice that you recently created a new page, Carlos Vives discography. First, thank you for your contribution; Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of volunteers such as yourself. Unfortunately, the page you created covers a topic on which we already have a page - Carlos Vives. Because of the duplication, your article has been tagged for speedy deletion. Please note that this is not a comment on you personally and we hope you will to continue helping improve Wikipedia. If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at Carlos Vives - you might like to discuss new information at the article's talk page.   If you think that the article you created should remain separate, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page that has been nominated for deletion (just below the existing speedy deletion or \"\"db\"\" tag - if no such tag exists then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hangon tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that they  userfy the page or have a copy emailed to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the article creation process and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia. Try not to be discouraged. Wikipedia looks forward to your future contributions.  \"	35877

0	\"==Some tips to help you out!== Hi , I thought I'd drop a few notes on your talk page with some help on writing articles o)  First of all, it may be best for you to do a bit of reading, starting with the Wikipedia manual of style, which will give you a lot of information about how Wikipedia prefers its articles to be written.  It's not as hard to follow as it might look; quite a bit of the information there probably won't be vital for you at first.  Second, I recommend you make a user sandbox - which is just an area you can use to practise in, and to make notes in, and to get things ready in.  If you click this red link: , that will let you create that page (it gives you an edit window to start work in).  Anything, anywhere, on the help and information pages which gives you an example, try it out in your sandbox until you're familiar with it.  For your article, the next thing you want to do is start collecting as much information as you can about it.  Google searches (particularly in Books and Scholar) will be your best friend for this!  Once you've found the information, the next most important thing is to start writing up each fact in your own words (very important, this), and make a note at the same time of exactly where that information came from.  Build in the references as you go along; I'm going to copy in, down below this, a whole heap of help on doing references, which was produced by one of our best teachers ().  Here's another place that you'll find incredibly useful - citation templates which you can copy and paste into your sandbox, between  tags; you just fill in the blanks from your sources into the template, and you'll end up with nicely formatted inline citations o)  It all helps.  Remember to add a references section to your sandbox (make a new line, and put ==References== on it, and type {{reflist}} on the next line, so that you can see how your citations look as you do them.  Remember to save your page often! You don't want to lose your work.  Hopefully this will give you a good start and make life easier for you.  One last thing to keep as a motto: \"\"It's better to write one good, well-referenced, nicely-presented article than it is to create fifty unreferenced one-line stubs!\"\"   …  ==How references work==  === Simple references ===  These require two parts;  :a)  Chzz is 98 years old. \"\"The book of Chzz\"\", Aardvark Books, 2009.   He likes tea.  [http://www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com Tea website]    :b) A section called \"\"References\"\" with the special code \"\"{{reflist}}\"\";  == References == {{reflist}}   (an existing article is likely to already have one of these sections)  To see the result of that, please look at . Edit it, and check the code; perhaps make a test page of your own, such as  and try it out.  === Named references ===   Chzz was born in 1837.  \"\"The book of Chzz\"\", Aardvark Books, 2009.     Chzz lives in Footown.    Note that the second usage has a / (and no closing ref tag). This needs a reference section as above; please see  to see the result.  === Citation templates ===  You can put anything you like between  and , but using citation templates makes for a neat, consistent look;   Chzz has 37 Olympic medals.  {{Citation  | last = Smith  | first = John  | title = Olympic medal winners of the 20th century  | publication-date = 2001  | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]  | page = 125  | isbn = 0-521-37169-4 }}    Please see  to see the result.

0	\"   You know that the name change is not at all the whole point here. The problems here such as heavily relying on Chinese sources, inaccuracy in historical facts, copying government propaganda, are commonplace not only in this particular article but most all topics on nations colonized under China. And further, if the current situation continues on Wikipedia, you cannot guarentee the so called NPOV. Not only that will be a joke, the whole Wikipedia thing will end up being another hypocratic, \"\"civilization\"\" game. The biggest issue here is the mentality behind the creation of these articles and problems here, hence the debate and this is just the beginning. You have to realize that the overwhelming articles on China-occupied regions on Wikipedia are full of POV but not NPOV. So don't keep fulling yourselves. It's time to wake up now.  Those who're currently in advantageous positions here, are so not because they're intelectually and morally strong but just because their numbers are bigger. They are basically consisted of two types: One types are those Chinese who're either been brainwashed and/or are chauvinistic fanatics. And the other types are Americans who (naturally) have so little knowledge about the world outside of northern America. But then they would have hard time admitting that and therefore, they will end up either pretending as they know or they would simply echo the Chinese POV which is largely circulated and readily available. For them, the famous saying, which goes like if you repeat a lie a thousand times it would become the truth, will make perfect sense. That \"\"truth\"\", or what you guys are shouting here as \"\"the common\"\" names and stuff, is exactly what is blocking not only your eyesights but as well your human consciousness.  One big difference between the two types though are that the Chinese here do know what they are doing because they have their agenda and they're intentional. But the Americans are just naive and are being used.   \"	36182

0	==Useful info== * practice is enlightenment In Zen terms we say honsho myoshu. Honsho means intrinsic enlightenment; myoshu, subtle practice. We say practice and enlightenment, or realization, are one. How is it one thing? When you sit, your zazen is the zazen of the Buddhas. Your zazen is sitting Buddha, or Buddha's zazen. So your practice is realization itself, enlightenment itself. Your zazen becomes anuttara samyak sambodhi itself. Have this kind of faith.  Usually when you do zazen, zazen becomes a cause to create some kind of effect, such as enlightenment, frustration, anger, or whatever arises. That is the wrong way to do zazen. Your practice is not something by which you attain some place else or something else. Your practice itself is a fulfillment of honsho myoshu, the originally enlightened life.	36206

In general, we have tried to use registration as the bar for notability for political parties. In some cases such as Palmer United, this has been waived - PUP got major, nationwide coverage for months before it was registered, and also had two Queensland state MPs within its ranks very quickly. Should the new Country Party (which is, I should add, extraordinarily unlikely to achieve registration under its current name) receive that kind of coverage, or get some defectors in its ranks, then we might make an exception for it too. In the meantime, this is simply a case of WP:TOOSOON. I know from a long time covering politics here that very many of these kinds of parties fade away quickly without ever doing anything much; I'm not saying that will happen here, but given this party is less than a month old I think it's too soon to be including it.

0	\"  :Dear C.Fred, this is ridiculous. I'm just conveying a fact, and Wikipedia is blocking me as soon as I do. I'm like the boy that states the fact that the emperor is naked, and you're among the public that tells him to be quiet. Can you please tell me what I possibly can write about clades and cladistics that will not block me? Anything that isn't right on the point? Cladistic is is in fact a mental desease. Is it possible to say that a mental desease is a mental desease? At the same time as Object-Oriented modeling is making great progress in geographical information systems (like you can see on CNN almost every night illustrating statistics for US and parts of it) and in a multitude of other applications, the inconsistent, self-contradictory and empirically erroneous cladism holds its fort against it by oppression of its opponents (for example blocking me). I have supported my statements with facts, and none of the influential cladists even dare to challenge them. Gareth Nelson tried every night for at least five months without success. The fact that he even tried is a measure of the importance he assesses them. In this continuing blocking of me, Wikipedia at least has to set a time limit as to when it regards the facts I'm stating (i.e., that time is relative) as being generally accepted (among cladists?). This discussion is totally and utterly ridiculous. Cladism does in fact deny that time can be relative, instead claiming that it is relations that are are relative, that is, that relative is relative. How long do we have to continue discussing a paranoia? Why not just conclude that it is a paranoia? Cladists don't understand that it is they that conceptualize reality, but instead think they find concepts. They think things have conceptual labels all around them, that they are branded. It is ridiculous, ridiculous...   :I thus contest being blocked for telling the truth. I argue that if telling the truth in itself is a reason for being blocked, then Wikipedia can certainly not be allocated to the category 'encyclopedia', since the definition of this concept surely must include telling the truth (to the best of its ability). If Wikipedia contest this argument, then I demand a specification of which part(s) of it. (I, however, have no illusions. I expect this contest to lead to my blocking from this page too. I expect to be blocked everytime I tell the truth. It doesn't stop me. I will continue telling the truth until it penetrates cladists foggy brains, or at least diagnoses their foggy brains as the foggy brains they are. In the meantime, Wikipedia will have major problems trying to hinder their confusion to spread to phylogenetics, evolution, medicine and maybe even science itself. Cladism actually hates science in its traditional form, i.e., as described by Karl Popper, and is presently trying to roll out its confusional mat over it. Just read the \"\"explanation\"\" of phylogenetics and you have to understand what I mean. It is totally impossible to make \"\"heads and tails\"\" of. If it belongs in an encyclopedia, then I'm Santa, Cladism is not science, but rather a reaction against science). Consist (presently at   )\"	36547

Please don't feel any need to insult me over this  I don't have any real belief that your interested in anything I have to say.  But anyway, in this imaginary world where you actually are interested in my advice, I would tell you that, in the capacity of an arbitrator, you've written a summary of the focus of the dispute that (a) includes an alleged statement of the opinion of one party to the dispute that that party has denied, and that (b) the other side of the dispute seems to think is inaccurate. Again in this imaginary world, I would suggest to you that maybe it would be more productive to re-write the damn summary that no one likes rather than, say, to write a new article about Wikilawyering.

In fairness, I think I should tell you that, while I do think you are absolutely wrong in this particular matter, and I really will pursue it to the very end, I find your attitude pretty amusing, and it is entertaining for me (in some dark way, perhaps) to see the innovative and gymnastic things you come up with in order to avoid doing what seems to me to be quite obviously the right thing to do. I'm telling you this because possibly you find the whole thing very annoying and draining  as indeed I would, if I were continually having to make up new reasons for not doing what is obviously the right thing to do  and if that's the case, this could be a bad situation for you: you're drained while I'm entertained. Now, probably some worthy will turn my words here against me, and claim (ignoring my clear statement that I think you are absolutely wrong in this particular matter) that I am just trying to be annoying to you. But I can deal with that, and it really is as a favor to you that I've informed you that I think this whole process is amusing to me.   \"	36611
0	Reforming Wikipedia is an impossible feat, i fail to see positive improvement on articles. I find it remarkable that so many keep reverting so much. The ability for growth is stifled. I have seen 99% of Maya books and articles use Ahau instead of Spanish Ajaw yet the editors of Wikipedia like to stand out as different. Only a hispanic would promounce Ajaw as Ahau. Is Wikipedia starting the new favored way! I find that's what happens to words. In the 1970's the Egyptian god Re was spelled in British manner where Re is pronounced as Ray and it refers to the sun on days where there are rays of light to cast measured shadows. So the americans changed it to Ra and no one says Ray, they all say Rah. Do this for 4000 years and its a wonder anything is truth and how we ever put up satellites to talk on cell phones so we can all misunderstand each other even in one same language. Can hearts of men reform. Please prove my doubts they will. I think truth is stifled and smothered. War exists even without religion because religion is NOT mere organized armies, religion is also mere individual political belief, or personal concepts of what is true, and it will rally people. It does right here, and in chats, and in bulletins. Woul not be caught by name on here, you all make me shame to be on.  ==Candidate for improvement?== 	36615

He made no attempt to simply fix the error. He made no attempt to contact me so I could fix the error. He then implied he did NOT delete everything, when he should have at least apologized for that error. He blamed me for everything, and in an insulting, condescending, arrogant way. Finally, he selectively edited our disagreement on his Talk page to make himself appear to be in the right. As a supposedly experienced Administrator (I note he started editing in 2003), all that is very wrong. I refuse to waste my time with a project which puts destructive people in leadership positions.

The secondary of a small multi-stage bomb is just another boosted fission stage, fusion yield negligible. The largest bomb ever tested (~50MT) was fairly clean, but only because the fissile tamper was removed from the secondary to reduce contamination. Small ultra-clean bombs have also been tested.  The article is about the current art of laser-driven ICF. Fission-driven ICF was the first mechanism used and has been proven, so a summary definitely belongs here.

0	I never said we need to cover up the fact. I said that the fact is irrelevant to anal sex, and the way it is presented in the article leads to a colorful and inaccurate interpretation of male-male anal sex. It is not the most straight-forward way to explain pleasure from male receptive anal sexit is factually and logically a roundabout way to do it, and it is misleading. Really, that's what the issue is. As I have several times mentioned, the only thing that is relevant to anal sex is that prostate stimulation can be pleasureable; it's homology with the Skene's gland is completely irrelevant. Also, do you think that the psychological factor plays no role in receptive pleasure? I personally think that it plays a larger role than the prostate does, but it isn't mentioned once in the article.  	37058

0	\"  :::First, you are misreading what your first source is. The document you reference is a UN interum report on Resolution 425. 425 dates back to 1978. That document (the report) does not reflect any agreement between the UN and Israel. 425 calls for many things, but there had been no public pledge from Israel on dismantling the SLA. In fact, Israel in public had been saying the opposite. They were not planning to leave until early July. The report being issued on the 22nd isn't very meaningful. Its coincidence. There was a whole series of meetings between the SLA (see later material) and UN/various countries that was a whole lot more damaging than the interium erport on 425.  :::Second, I think its better to deal with Charbel Barakat's fuller and more accurate version of what happened in May from his congressional testimony in June 2000:  \"\"During the month of May 2000 our people remitted a memorandum to the office of the United Nations in Nakura in south Lebanon offering suggestions to avoid bloodshed and exodus. During the same month delegations representing our community met with diplomats of the US, UK, and French embassies in Israel and at the United Nations. And on May 18, our representatives met with the office of the Secretary General of the United Nations in New York ... Instead of taking our demands for protection on our land seriously, the United Nations declined to assist us ... The United States, UK and France dismissed our fears and insisted on guarantees which were allegedly granted by the Beirut regime ... The State of Israel only prepared for our potential exodus, ruling out our determination to remain on our land and defend ourselves.\"\"  \"\"Despite the abandonment by the international community and against all odds, our people decided to remain and fight for their land and rights while calling endlessly on the UN to deploy its units around our villages.  On May 22, 2000, and as Israeli units were implementing their own withdrawal and the commander of the SLA was absent in France, the mostly Shiite sector of the security zone collapsed. It appeared that Shiite officers were told by the Israelis that they must leave before the borders closed. Even after the invasion of Hizbollah of this area, the mostly Christian-Druse eastern enclave and the Christian western enclave, decided to defend themselves and protect their citizens after Israel’s withdrawal. On May 23, 2000, at 8 PM, SLA officers in the western sector received orders from the Israelis to leave their posts as Hizbollah was advancing towards their villages. Thus the SLA was imploded from the inside and was dismantled without any battle. The main reason why the SLA did not remain and fight was the fact that the border was closed behind its back. Without access to medical and logistical supplies, our people was condemned either to surrender to its enemy or flee across the border.\"\" (from [www.10452lccc.com/special%20studies/barakatjune2000.htm])  :::The SLA did collapse. What Charbel Barakat is talking about in the MEF comments is that the remainder of the SLA (Christian) in the west did not collapse and was dismanted by Israel. But it was only dismanted after most of the SLA had collapsed. Charbel Barakat and other dead-enders may have wanted (in theory anyway) to fight on in the west, but Israel wasn't going to make any commitment to keep a miniture version of the SLA going in a tiny pocket on the west end of the border. The caution I would give about Barakat and a couple others from the SLA is that sometimes they think of their Christian portion of the SLA as if it were the entire SLA. And from that point of view, the SLA did not collapse and was dismantled by Israel.  :::The biggest claim made by Barakat is in weasel-words: \"\"It appeared that Shiite officers were told by the Israelis that they must leave\"\". 'It appeared that\"\" means he is guessing. Nobody on either side of the border has outright claimed that the Shites were told to leave and that is why they collapsed on the 22nd. Even Barakat is unwilling to make that claim.  :::Now lots of other things may have happened that the public doesn't know about with regard to the SLA collapse. But the only people who would know the truth are a handful of people at the top of the Israeli government and army. Nobody in the SLA knows much of anything because if Israel was going to collapse them, they would hardly tell them their plan. People (including me) can make lots of hunches and theories about what might have happened, but there are no facts to back any of those theories up.  \"	37088

I can't see how this could have ended up in any result but no consensus - not just because of the numbers but because of the sensible arguments on either side.  You also deleted Sommer Isdale while completely ignoring the strong argument made by After Midnight, again this should at least have been no consensus.  Finally, in the case of Annilie Hastey, you deleted it even though there were more comments suggesting that the article be kept. Again here you claimed crystal ballery, but the majority of comments didn't even touch on this.  I am letting you know that I would like you to reconsider these deletions, and to let you know that when you have had a chance to respond I am taking this to Deletion Review because I think these deletions were unfair.  I feel I have a fairly good case, because in Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kari Schull, an article in the same series was closed as keep.  	37284

Since you seem to have all the right skills, I wondered whether you might be tempted to work more on the Middleham Hoard article or on other English Civil War hoards with support from York Museums Trust's numismatics curator ? It would be great for our GLAM-wiki partnership to establish direct links between curators and active editors (other than myself!). Particularly ones with specialist knowledge. Any thoughts?

To be honest, I did feel a little put down by your earlier comment; I rather carelessly pulled the offending term out of the air without giving it sufficient thought, for which I apologize.  I don't pretend to be an archaeologist (a couple of digs and a term at university in the late 1970s hardly count), but I enjoy contributing to archaeological articles precisely because I am not an expert in the field, and editing helps me learn more about subjects that interest me.    ::Hi!

So that link has now been moved per WP:LAYOUT. Its available to readers but cannot be used to assert or confirm notability on enWiki.

Managment consulting currently has a very broad meaning.

The article related to Nestorian christians(Church of the East), Syriac Orthodox, Saint Thomas Christians of India etc have been attacked and manipulated. Assyrian Christians who were more or less Iconoclasts and abhorred themselves from extreme forms of marian devotion, are presented in these newly edited articles as adhering to the Roman Pope.

You have several options freely available to you: * If you can relieve my concern through discussing it here, I can stop worrying about it. * If the two of us can't agree here, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, such as asking for a \"\"third opinion\"\", or requesting comments from other Wikipedians.

0	\"  ==Macedonians== Hi Realek, sorry if I didn't awnser yesterday, but you seemed a bit angry with me, so I decided that letting some time pass would have helped to calm all down. Now, passing to your last message, let me thank you for having clearly stated your objections. Now I'll try to awnser your points:  #Tito's actions had a number of important consequences for the Macedonians. The most important was, obviously, the promotion of a distinctive Macedonian identity as a part of the multiethnic society of Yugoslavia. The process of ethnogenesis gained momentum, and a distinct national Macedonian identity was formed. **The first part was already there: \"\"Tito's actions had a number of important consequences for the Macedonians. The most important was, obviously, the promotion of a distinctive Macedonian identity as a part of the multiethnic society of Yugoslavia.\"\" As for the second part, \"\"The process of ethnogenesis gained momentum, and a distinct national Macedonian identity was formed\"\", I admit responsability; but I only wanted to mean that the birth of the SRoM represented the completition of the formation of a Macedonian national identity, not that Macedonians were \"\"invented\"\" in 1945; an identity that freed itself of the ambiguities and contraddictions that were present in the fathers of Macedonian nationalism, like Misirkov and Delchev. If you want to put it better, feel free to do it. #Greek Macedonians are actually an ethnic group **I think you know quite well how I feel about this, as I clearly stated it in the talk page. But sometimes compromises are necessary; and after all, it's only stated that \"\"Greek Macedonians\"\" live in Macedonia, not that they represent an ethnic group. And it does seem that the Greeks who live in Macedonia call themselves Macedonians,like those that live in Crete call themselves Cretans. #Tito separated Yugoslav Macedonia from Serbia **I think you must have wrongly interpreted this; I simply thought it meant that Macedonia was administratively separated from Serbia, under whose control in the Kingdom of Serbia before and that of Yugoslavia after it had been #There was no resentment towards the Bulgarian repression during the beginning of the Bulgarian occupation of the region, by removing that sentance. **Honestly the removal of this sentence slipped me, but I can't help noting now that the statement is unsourced. Personally, I don't know how Macs reacted to Bulgarian occupation. After all, my field is ancient, not modern Macedonia. In conclusion remember that I only edited Telex's text, without adding new statements. In my view, the best way to awnser to those editors who say that the Macedonians were invented in 1945 is in collecting good, strong sources. For example, to make some names, Danforth's Macedonian Question or Poulton's Who are the Macedonians. As for Telex, you should remember that it's a wiki rule to not bite newbies. Telex is a very recent that is among us only since April 25, and is clearly not a nationalist, but a honest editor who is striving to be NPOV. If you believe to see bias in his editing, remember that every single editor here (me included, obviously) has his POV, and it's a pure illusion that we can kept them out of our editing. This is why wikipedia has great possibilities: because our bias are emended by the work of others. Sorry this was so long. Ciao ;-) \"	38112

I'm really tired with all this and very keen to find a compromise. I offered what I thought was a reasonable compromise tonight and Felix immediately deleted it (including the enhanced section on global warming that you wrote and I much preferred).   Felix and I are clearly going to keep alternating edits, me putting them in, him cutting, me putting them back, etc etc, which seems like a real waste of time. That isn't good for wiki, and it's frankly very tedious.  If you could check in to the discussion and just adjudicate on (a) the public domain picture I keep posting, and (b) the sections on nuclear disarmament, global warming and the line and the environment, it would really save a lot of time. If you decide against me I will totally abide by that; if you decide against felix, I hope he will too. - Dave	38221

Since it was raised on the Evidence pageby meyou cannot not have been aware of the fact that she was sanctioned for similar behavior in 2010. You also must have been aware of the fact that she had accused me several times of being a sockpuppet of Dylan somebody-or-other, and made other strange assertions, as I detailed on the Evidence page. You seem to have ignored all of the above in your vote regarding sanctions against Malke, and voted for sanctions against me before any discussion of the FoF had even had a chance to take place.  So, I am investigating you, independently, as it were. You may find that amusing, but I have just explained the rationale, and I hope you take me seriously.   If you'd care to explain what you found most offensive in my editing conduct on that article, it might save me the time an effort of examining your interaction history with Malke to see whether or not maybe you should have recused yourself from the case altogether, or at least from voting on Malke, as NYB did (recuse himself).見学/迷惑 \"	38262

Creating separate pages for these tightly related subjects both causes editorial hassles (trying to keep the two pages in sync and needing to decide whether a piece of information belongs on one page or the other) and reduces the likelihood that a reader will get the whole story (because most people will only read one of them).  Also, keeping it all here may reduce the temptation to use the biography for (self-)promotion of the politically active parents and/or their organization.  IMO merging/not splitting is the better answer.   \"	38524

0	\"   I am not sure if I understand your reply above correctly: * UNSD uses the term  \"\"statistics divisions\"\"  ( I agree, but the term refers to division(s) in the UN headquarter or agencies in different countries, NOT a specific way of geographic divisions of the world.) * You still prefer previous title (i.e. \"\"United Nations statistical divisions\"\") to the current one (i.e. \"\"United Nations geoscheme\"\")? If so, please allow me to repeat a bit on the following: * The term \"\"Statistics Division\"\"(capitalized singular form) in the UN context refers to the organization of United Nations Statistics Division with the website at unstats.un.org. * The term \"\"statistical divisions\"\"(plural form) can mean any categorization schemes, not just geographical ones. Google this: \"\"statistical divisions\"\" site:un.org * The term \"\"statistical divisions\"\"(plural form) can ALSO mean any organization bodies who are doing statisitcal work in governments.  Google this: \"\"statistical divisions\"\" site:un.org Therefore, it is not advisable to use the ambigous general term \"\"statistical divisions\"\", or the wrong organization term  \"\"Statistics Division\"\" to refer to UN M.49 . UN statistical divisions can refer to any agencies doing statisitcal work under the UN system, or imply that there are certain UN statistical categorization schemes in a general sense (not geographical).   I agree that UN geoscheme is widely used for stastitcs and ALSO mapping. Natural Earth has region_un and subregion metadata for each country. I use it quiet often. It is why I notice that most of academic work refer this geographic categorization/classification scheme as \"\"UN geoscheme\"\". Try Google BOOK search and you will find at least the following: *\"\"The best option to identify the states from Asia could be use the United Nations (UN) geoscheme for Asia. As per this, Asia is subdivided to four broad categories:....\"\" *\"\"The UN geoscheme defines the region as all states of mainland North America south of the United States; conversely, the European Union excludes Belize and Mexico from its definition of the region ....\"\" *\"\"Country groups are based on UN Geoscheme and World Bank regional classification.\"\" *\"\"...were grouped into regions and subregions based on the United Nations Geoscheme (http://unstats.un.org /unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm)\"\" *\"\"... that the United Nations Statistics Division would later classify as Eastern Asia, Southern Asia and Southeastern Asia according to its geoscheme. In fact ...\"\"  I also agree that many UN agencies (in fact, many other reports, consultancies, etc. have different \"\"statistical divisions\"\" (in the general sense of categorization schemes) for research. This is exactly why I believe the term \"\"UN geoscheme\"\" is better. Although it is NOT official term or a technical term (UN M.49), I have not yet found an ambigous use of the term. Correct me if I am wrong on this, so far every online and academic citations that I have found when the term  \"\"UN geoscheme\"\" is used, it refers to exactly the regions and subregions as defined in UN M.49 .   Moving forwards, since don't have the time nor will to take it to RM, and if you do not have any further couter-evidence or -arguments with the evidence and claims that I layed out above, I can help by making the necessary editing without going to RM.

0	I do not agree with you about that at all. In fact, Kerry's Senate Office web site displays in great detail the history of each and every bill that Kerry has sponsored over the last 10 years. Sponsorship of bills which eventually become law is indeed a measure of a Senator's effectiveness. That being the case, raw data about numbers and eventual results do matter.  :: Now as to the point you make which is that there are also other measures of effectiveness. That indeed can be true, but I can find no data trail on Kerry's Sentate Office web site which supplies me with information about any bills which Kerry, either as an significant amender or as a co-sponsor, helped become law. I would like to see some information about bills which Kerry co-sponsored which became law. I am sure there are some, I just haven't located any data which corroorates that, have you?  Also, the raw statistics about what did and did not become law is a concise window into this area. In addition to the table showing numerical results, what else do you suggest we add to give a more detailed view into Kerry's work product in the Senate?  	38693

0	\"  ==@Hans Adler, truth and/or verifiability==  Let's talk about truth and/or verifiability. You had corrected the name \"\"Stadtzeitung\"\" we have in note #4 of this article into \"\"Stattzeitung\"\", because only the latter was verifiable, you said. Then, by chance, somebody found out the link to the \"\"Stadtzeitung für Freiburg\"\" and the erroneous correction could be reverted. Notice that if there had been no documentation of the \"\"Stadtzeitung für Freiburg\"\" online, but only, say, in a press archive in Freiburg, or if nobody had made the effort to verify the verifiability, the error would not have been detected, and the \"\"truth\"\" would now be, erroneously, \"\"Stattzeitung\"\". A beautiful mistake, by the way, very evangelical, being of the same sort as those we can find in the manuscripts of the Gospel.   ;-)  But let us apply this to another case, take Anton van Hooff, who is in charge to turn King's evidence for \"\"pseudo-science\"\", \"\"severe methodological flaws\"\" and \"\"factual errors\"\". Of course, he has written this, among several name-callings, so this is verifiable. But can we take it seriously? If we look closer we see that the first accusation of van Hooff towards Carotta was to not have taken into account the well known Tacitus-passage about Nero and the \"\"christians\"\". But since Carotta had treated it in detail, van Hooff was exposed, because he had shown that he had attacked a book without having read it, so that he himself was convicted of the \"\"severe methodological flaws\"\" and \"\"factual errors\"\" he tried to impute to other people. The subsequent escalation with the accusation of \"\"pseudo-science\"\" was only his embarrassing attempt to divert from the lack of professionality he had shown. This, too, can be verified. The question is then: Which verification is relevant?  Van Hooff is refered to as a \"\"Senior lecturer of Ancient History and Teacher Trainer for Classics at Nijmegen University, the Netherlands\"\" in the link given in note #17. But we see that at the University of Sofia he is also called \"\"Professor Associate\"\". Looking on the Internet we can verify that he is called a \"\"professor\"\" on several websites. Looking closer we can also verify that he was never a professor, and is by now a teacher in a secondary school, as he himself stated in a newspaper article. So what have we truly verified? That he is a confidence trickster who let himself be called a professor without actually being one, in order to improve his authority as an alleged important scholar? If we look to the list of publications he is giving there, we see that he is speaking of \"\"numerous books and articles\"\" but specifies only one title. Modesty or showing-off?  Van Hooff being a notorious polemicist, can his accusations be taken seriously? Nobody does it in The Netherlands (why is there no article about him in the Dutch WP? – The only Antoon van Hooff listed there is a zoo director, who was ashamed of the homonymy), but he is taken seriously here, in the English WP where most \"\"judges\"\" do not even understand Dutch. Why? Because it is so stated in the German WP already? If we take a look at the history there, we can verify that somebody had first put the article in the category \"\"Pseudowissenschaft\"\" (pseudo-science), but then, this being not allowed because libelous, they \"\"discovered\"\" \"\"Van Hooff\"\", taking him as \"\"proof\"\", without examining his credibility, happy to have the possibility to maintain their libelous allegation in an appearance of legality: it is \"\"only\"\" a quotation! ;-)  So much about verifiability and truth.

What Updegrove, Califano and other historians take issue with is how Johnson, who spearheaded the drive to pass the Civil Rights legislation and who proactively engaged and supported King, is portrayed as either a reluctant or obstructionist actor or self-interested opportunist.

0	== Deletions ==  WilliamJE, I wanted to let you know why I've modified some of your edits. While you're to be commended for trying to pare down Notable people lists, the usual procedure for dealing with unsourced material is to tag it first. This gives other editors notice of the issue and provides them with some time to find reliable sources. If, after some time has passed after a {{cn}} was placed, and no one has provided a citation, then the material can be deleted. In several instances you were very quick to delete material that didn't yet have a source. Yet I was able to quite readily find a source for the deleted material. Deleting material without notice may mean that valid information is deleted from an article because other editors weren't given notice of the issue and time to rectify it. So maybe you want to think about tagging unsourced material, rather than just deleting it.   	38866

1	\" :::::Hello again, Tdadamemd. Getting right to your comment about slang, I don't understand your stating that \"\"fuck\"\" is not slang, or your linking to dictionary.com as proof that it is not. The word \"\"fuck,\"\" while vulgar, is also slang; the dictionary.com source you cited even states so. It makes it clear that it can be slang for a variety of things, including sexual intercourse/other sexual activity. It list 13 numbered examples regarding what \"\"fuck\"\" can mean. As for Wiktionary, I don't refer to sources like that. And, yes, I am fine with mentioning \"\"fuck\"\" (or \"\"fucking\"\") and the euphemism \"\"sleeping together\"\" lower in the article, in the the Definitions and stimulation factors section, as alternative words for sexual intercourse/sexual activity. But again, there are a lot of terms for sexual intercourse, most of them slang. That these terms exist doesn't mean that all of them should be in this article. In fact, most times when there are many alternative terms for a word, especially if those terms are slang, we don't include all of them. As you know, this is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary.   :::::If WP:CONSENSUS is achieved for including your proposal, I'll add it by briefly summarizing that there are various vulgar and/or slang terms and euphemisms for sexual intercourse/other sexual activity...such as \"\"fuck\"\" and \"\"sleeping together\"\" (the wording won't be exactly like that, of course). And, really, because there are so many terms for sexual intercourse, and \"\"fuck\"\" is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse (by that, I mean that most people and sources are not discussing the word \"\"fuck\"\" when discussing sexual intercourse), that is probably why \"\"fuck\"\" isn't currently in this article. Someone who is aware of your having repeatedly added it to the lead expressed to me via email me that \"\"fuck\"\" is also U.S.-centric; so that's also something to think about, though the term is also used outside of the United States.   :::::Also, sexual intercourse does not = fuck. It's that fuck = sexual intercourse; in its literal sense anyway, since when people use the term...they are usually using it as profanity. That is also why I told you \"\"The Fuck article mentions sexual intercourse in its lead because it is especially relevant to the topic. However, the term 'fuck' is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse.\"\"   :::::I cannot see how this article is broken simply because it doesn't currently include \"\"fuck.\"\" But, like I stated, I don't mind adding it to the article. I'd rather see what others have to state on that matter first, however.   \"	38887

0	\"   :Is it scientific to attribute an event A, to cause B, where cause B was deliberate designed, with some sort of intelligent intent? Don't answer the questions beyond that ::Well, the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. There are several major fundamental problems here.    ::First, you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth. Natural science might look at a honeycomb, see it is built by bees, and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb, and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here. This is not science in any sense of the word, it is mythology. When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox, they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. No evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean, really.    ::Second, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with \"\"probabilities\"\". If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? If you don't understand it, you can't do statistics on it. ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn't have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say \"\"well, it's so improbable for this to happen, that someone MUST have designed it\"\". This is such a perversion of science. You can assign probabilities to something you don't understand. ID is just making up their numbers.    ::Finally, your example has A->B, where B was deliberate design. that's all well and good for a rigged example, except that with respect to life on earth, \"\"B\"\" is unknown. Your A->B example might qualify as forensic science, if \"\"A\"\" were a dead body and \"\"B\"\" were a bullet in the heart. You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart, the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart, you can probably figure that's what killed him. You don't have that with life on earth. You have ONE scenario, \"\"A\"\", and you have no other cases to observe or test. So, in that sense, A->B is not scientific if you've never actually observed \"\"B\"\". (btw, B is teh intelligent designer, which has NEVER been observed). So, in that sense, no, it isn't science.  \"	38914

0	\"   Regarding the \"\"Speedy Deletion\"\" of my entry for The Resonance Project  I am unfamiliar with this interface so hopefully this is the proper \"\"talk\"\" process.    I have no affiliation with The Resonance Project aside from Nassim Haramein's lectures giving some validation to ideas I have been thinking about for a long time, but for which it has been hard to find reliable information about. At times the subject seems to have been suppressed by the science establishment either purposefully or just out of hubris, and anyone discussing the subject publicly ridiculed.  Either way it's \"\"flat-earth society\"\" type behaviour that I find objectionable.  I understand your points but disagree, particularly on the notability aspect.  I can easily find scores of entries regarding subjects of less notability than The Resonance Project on Wikipedia.  I am suspicious of the motivation to so quickly suppress my expression of free speech in this so called \"\"community\"\".  Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it, and by doing so silenced my opinions.  Thats wrong.  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the \"\"Speedy Deletion\"\" I could find no such option.  When you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar, and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas, then you have a problem.

Wake up  Wikipedia editors...open your eyes and minds and be a force for good in the world, not another puppet.  This new field of spiritual science or Unified Physics, whatever you want to call it, is an important subject and needs to be represented in the sphere of social consciousness whether you agree with it or not.  There are thriving social media communities of 300,000+ individuals on both The Resonance Project and Hassim Harramein's Facebook pages, and yet Wikipedia via it's ignorant (sorry it's true) editors quickly dismiss as not notable.  It's notable enough for 300,000 people to include the information provided by Nassim Haramein and The Resonance Project in their social media feeds, who are you to dismiss so many people's opinions?  300,000 people think about that.  If I gather the neccessary information would you be willing to help me organize it in such a manner as to pass muster of the Wikipedia editorial drones?   \"	39009

Perhaps his behaviour deserved these intimate revelations, but that is not for Wikipedia to judge. Bloggers, tabloids and columnists are, as we all know, highly partial. I do not see how a Wikipedia biography can reproduce such intimate revelations without breaching the spirit of its neutrality. Btw whether the Winterton allegations are appropriate is open to question; reproduction of media speculation about unverifiable allegations does not seem to be within Wikipedia's biography guidelines.

I found the site outside the wall on my space, and since then have found it to be quicker on posting news and tour info then any of the other sites. I think it deserves a link here with the others. I must admit, I messed up the link by missing a few rules to begin, but since then have fixed that. Dharmabum420 said it seemed self promotion, well I simply just copied the title of the page, it is not self promotion. Since then I have written what features the site holds, but it continues to be removed. Google stats do not legitimate how good a site is for info, and this is NOT a rule by Wikipedia, so stop treating it as one. Thank you, please keep the link  :I would suggest the link be removed until a consensus can be reached here. :I'll assume that it's not self-promotion despite the earlier \"\"greatest site ever!\"\" type description, but regardless, I would personally argue against the inclusion of the site, for a variety of reasons: :#Wikipedia is not a link repository, and guidlines suggest only one fan site for such an article, and we already have far more than that. :#No Google hit within the first 100 links in a \"\"pink floyd\"\" search and no Alexa rating; while not a set policy on Wikipedia, such rankings are often used to determine a site's notability when trying to decide whether to include the site in an article already well-stocked with other, high-rated sites. :#The only content on the site that is not easily available on far more popular sites is a selection of photos of people's tattoos. While mildly interesting, it's hard to argue that it increases the value of the Pink Floyd article itself, as few people who read the article will be searching it out for information on Pink Floyd tattoos. :#Much content on the site is commerical, marketing T-shirts and the like. This is clear in the discography, which holds no information other than a simple list of the albums (available on Wikipedia itself anyway) with links to purchase them to an Amazon seller account. :#The site in question is very low-quality compared to the rest of the resource links; confusing, messy and difficult to navigate, intrusive music with no way of turning it off, and it has major compatibility problems with Firefox 1.5 and Safari (perhaps others, that's what I've got to try). :That's my 2¢ on this particular site. - a   ::I'll double 's 2¢ and even add in another penny to make it an even nickel. It's a very sub-par site and doesn't contribute anything to this article.    ::I will disagree with both of you. while you claim only one fan site is appropriate, it clearly states \"\"Note: fanlistings are generally not informative and should not ordinarily be included.)\"\" this fansite is very imformative and has more details on wanted details. For example, this site has details about a On an island live dvd with a direct link to saying David will record the rah shows for a dvd. Visit the other sites, none of them have this info and this is just one instance. You are wrong about it being the normal material. Also after paying attention to this site for sometime, it has continued to be the first in announcing tour dates for Rogers tour, and apparently has already secured a interview with one of Rogers bandmates. While you may think that the videos on the site are annoying, many fans love this. I am one of them, I cant think of another site where I can view much of the videos on this site. You say its difficult to navigate and I laugh at that, there is a simple naviagtion bar at the left hand side of each page, just like fleeting glimpses bar. Also every site has a discography, but very few have a videography, this alon makes this site better then most. So it has some comercial availability...so what? It still is a great source of info. Your google pink floyd rankings are a joke. 80 out of the first 100 are not updated and far subpar then this site. I wonder how many people search for pink floyd tattos, probably far more then you think, because I for one know of no other site that has this, and I have picked a tat from the site to get myself. This site deserves a link and I disagree with both of you  :: Also now that I think about it, show me another site that streams Davids mermaid gig, or has each of his promo videos for tracks of the new album?

0	\" :I agree with you that Mansfield probably wouldn't object to the label. He's willing to write a book about manliness, after all! ) But I don't think I'm being oversensitive. I've seen a concerted effort by numerous editors on the Wikipedia to stigmatize various Bush administration officials, and it often involves linking together Leo Strauss, neoconservatism, and the War in Iraq. At one time, I thought the Wikipedia guideline on biographies of living persons required that the subject of articles \"\"publicly identify with the belief in question\"\" (at least I thought it did although I can't find the relevant passage now) and I assumed that's why the comment in the article said \"\"Mansfield has self identified as a Straussian.\"\" So when I downloaded the interview and it turned out that it did not substantiate the claim, I changed the language without changing the substance. There are so many conspiracy theories out there about Leo Strauss and the War in Iraq (see G-hits for the search terms [\"\"Leo Strauss\"\" War Iraq]) that I tend to be vigilant with notable students of Leo Strauss, since the word \"\"Straussian\"\" has been highjacked by critics and used pejoritively. Is there a reason you feel strongly about using the word \"\"Straussian\"\"? I don't think being a Straussian is anything to be ashamed of, but I don't like to see the Wikipedia being used for POV pushing by people who misunderstand Strauss. Thank you for the civil reply.

I want to be a contributing member here and not just a one issue person. It just happens that this particular issue, Ben's page, is something that I am devoting everything I can to..I believe in it, and in what has happened because of him. I truly do not mean to be disrespectful to other members, but find that I see room for interpretation in many policies and...I'm finding that I have a problem with the jabs flying around. I hear what you are saying about the page not being the place to argue about the policies...but that seems to get folded into things when people can look at the very same words and see different things. I am not ashamed to say that I am literally praying that this page does not get deleted. There was a huge impact here and I did take the time to read approximately 600-800 messages left to Ben on places like Legacy.om and on his Breedlove tv channel. It is not cliche stuff; it is real, poignant, and in many cases very specific examples of how he changed their lives. To me, it is also noteworthy when thousands of teenagers risk peer judgement to leave such messages. This is a phenomenon that happens to fall within the category of something making things better. I hope that has a place in cultural history at Wikipedia. As for navigating through this new world here at Wikipedia...I'm more confused than I have ever been.

After Davis sent Aquino his acceptance on March 17, 1973, he was presented with the honorary membership on April 13, 1973 by Aquino and Karla LaVey alone. ASL did not meet Davis until August 1973. Davis would later renounce Satanism, claiming later he was \"\"only into it for the chicks\"\" and re-embraced Judaism. At a nationaly televised event honoring him a few weeks before he died, Davis said \"\"First of all, I want to thank Jesus for letting me be here tonight\"\", completely shattering any doubt he had any lingering affinty to Satanism. Davis had been an activist for civil rights, and battled racism, in contrast to the racists and Neo-nazis that often embrace Satanism.

0	\" : To be honest, I think that this is a fair comment. Accordingly, (and as this is a much debated article), I would like to propose this revised opening paragraph:  The terms Old Style (or O.S.) and New Style (or N.S.) are used in English language historical studies to indicate that the dating system used in the source material is one or other of the (historic) methods for determining the day on which the year starts. In the Old Style dating, the year began on 25 March, whereas in the New Style it began on 1 January.Death warrant of Charles I web page of the UK National Archives A demonstration of New Style meaning Julian calendar with a start of year adjustment. Additionally (more so in other parts of the world), the terms are used to indicate the change from the historic calendar [for example, the Julian calendar in Europe and the Americas] to the (modern) Gregorian calendar.The October (November) Revolution Britannica encyclopaedia, A demonstration of New Style meaning the Gregorian calendar.Stockton, J.R. Date Miscellany I: The Old and New Styles \"\"The terms 'Old Style' and 'New Style' are now commonly used for both the 'Start of Year' and 'Leap Year' [(Gregorian calendar)] changes (England & Wales: both in 1752; Scotland: 1600, 1752). I believe that, properly and historically, the 'Styles' really refer only to the 'Start of Year' change (from March 25th to January 1); and that the 'Leap Year'  change should be described as the change from Julian to Gregorian.\"\"Spathaky, Mike Old Style New Style dates and the change to the Gregorian calendar. \"\"increasingly parish registers, in addition to a new year heading after 24th March showing, for example '1733', had another heading at the end of the following December indicating '1733/4'. This showed where the New Style 1734 started even though the Old Style 1733 continued until 24th March. .. We as historians have no excuse for creating ambiguity and must keep to the notation described above in one of its forms. It is no good writing simply 20th January 1745, for a reader is left wondering whether we have used the Old or the New Style reckoning. The date should either be written 20th January 1745 O.S. (if indeed it was Old Style) or as 20th January 1745/6. The hyphen (1745-6) is best avoided as it can be interpreted as indicating a period of time.\"\"  * References are unchanged from current version   Comments?   \"	39561

Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies.   If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or \"\"db\"\" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.    \"	39663

0	\"  :  :# Sandstein apparently thinks that everything not being a compliment is ipso facto derogatory. There is also another possibility that hasn't crossed his mind: neutral. No English dictionary has (derogatory) or (offensive) label next to the definition of the word nationalist. However, in Sandstein's native language the word nationalist does have a derogatory undertone. Here is the link to the definition of Nationalismus in the most authoritative German dictionary (Duden), where it has a label (meist abwertend) which translates into English as \"\"mostly pejoratively\"\". In German it's used as a pejorative, in English it isn't and it belongs to the neutral register. I suspect that Sandstein mixed two entirely different usage contexts for otherwise related words with the same meaning, in two different languages. :# It was not my intention to make any kind of personal attack. If you look at my edit history you can see that my behavior has been nothing short of exemplary. I have never heard anyone complaining about being offended by calling them nationalist. More often than not, it is I who is on the receiving end of abuse which sometimes provokes abrasive responses. If someone said that they are offended I would've stopped. :# Sandstein's condescending comment about me apparently failing to understand something (what?), justifying the \"\"educational\"\" component of the block by such lack of understanding is borderline insulting. Perhaps Sandstain trains his dog by taking punitive measures when puppy does something wrong, but may I remind him that we're dealing with human actors here that are not Fachidioten with blinders that only respond to Pavlovian stimuli dispensed by the master with his block^Wstick. An administrator should not be making such comments when blocking other users. They shouldn't probably be thinking of editors as offenders that ought to be subject to corrective measures (blocks) for their infractions (policy violations), but at least they could keep it to themselves. :# OK, let's say I crossed the line with nationalist name-calling. I didn't mean to use derogatorily, but I can accept that it is not an appropriate conduct. But what does that have to do with ARBMAC and the excessively long block? As I far I can see the guidelines on the WP:PA require posting a message on user's talkpage and seeking mediation. None of that happened. PA is a community-approved policy which takes precedence over anything ArbCom decides, or any admin \"\"broadly interprets\"\". A week is something that trolls and bad-faith editors get. Surely it's too excessive? :# This whole circus is a result of content dispute with the user who submitted the enforcement request. It was not made in good faith and his ulterior goal is to remove me from editing a set of low-importance articles that are currently not in a NPOV state. He also submitted a sockpuppet investigation against me with evidence such as last-year's sarcastic comment of mine on a sister project, as well as edits that I made years ago. With all that in mind, I must say that Wikipedia community has become very effective at giving partisan editors tools to target undesirable editors - a Byzantine collection of policies which admins overzealously enforce without a second thought, and without thinking of a big picture. Admins in fact are incentivized not to involve themselves, which basically gives the enforcement gun to POV-pushers which are intimately acquainted with all the glorious details of the relevant wikilese. I urge admins to think outside the policy-enforcing request-observing mode and think whether blocking me in any way helps to resolve the pending content disputes.   \"	39746
